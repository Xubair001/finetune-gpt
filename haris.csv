"@Xulfiqar Sir i want to know what precautions should we take when we overhaul a 2.5 kva generator? I have to replace to block as it has been cracked... and also the connecting rod is broken, now i want to overhaul then engine, the mechanic said that he will install new block and he will also bore it... Now i want to know how to make sure that rings seat properly, as i have read your post regarding break in period of car that we should not hold on one rpm and also not idle for break in period... So how can we manage that on generator? And also tell me other things like should i run it without load initially and also tell me can i do the break in period on gas or not? and plz also point other points of precautions... @Hassan1991 @brownrose78 @capsat @ etc **Yes i do have copied the title","To ensure a successful overhaul of your 2.5 kVA generator engine, it's crucial to follow the service manual diligently. The rebuild process should mirror that of a standard engine, with particular attention to setting gaps correctly to eliminate the need for a break-in period. Additionally, understanding the generator's specific RPM range, governed by controllers, is essential. While removing these controllers may allow RPM control akin to an engine, adherence to the manual's instructions renders this unnecessary. Marking components during disassembly facilitates straightforward reinstallation. Regarding fuel, a preference for petrol over CNG is recommended, given CNG's propensity for running hotter and drier. Regular oil changes, slightly before scheduled intervals, aid in draining any metal dust accumulation, with periodic switches between CNG and petrol advised to mitigate adverse effects on valves and valve seats. Lastly, consider adjusting tappets during the second oil change, typically occurring between 80-90 hours of operation.",,

"This thread is dedicated for discussion on Civic 2010 Navigation Panel only. I just want to post few ideas and want to know if that can be done. There is option of TV in navigation panel so is there any option on backside of the panel to attach antenna with it and will channels like PTV and STN work with it then. Or is there any other way I connect TV to that navigation panel. Secondly, how do we use REAR Camera while not in reverse gear. There is a option of rear in Meny but when I click on it it displays black screen. There is arrow on the top right when I press it and enters code 0000 it accepts and give me option to confirm but when i press it nothing happens. (0000 is accepted while any other code it gives error) Thirdly, my memory card SD is on FAT32 file system with 5 folders and 10 songs in each folder but the system does not play it. Does anybody know why and how can I use it? Fourth, How can I update my maps and stuff because i think its outdated. I have a trick to change the picture that you see when you switch off your navigation mode. Open the memory card in your computer and you will see that ROAD picture. Open the picture in Paint Brush and edit as you want. You can paste your picture or add text to existing picture. customization looks good. I have done that and it works. (To avoid problems first copy your memory card as it is to your computer as a back up)","In the context of vehicle technology, a discussion on Civic 2010 Navigation Panel unfolded with queries and insights.

My car's tire measurements are 185/65. Recently one of the back tire got into an accident and got burst. Thankfully I had a tire which was of 185/60 that I got installed. Is that a issue that the back tires of my car have 2 different tire profiles (one is 185/65 and another is 185/60)?,"Quite a big issue, among many things that will be affected will be Handling, Stability, Tire wear (damage risk), Suspension wear, Economy, Comfort, etc. The difference may seem small but the diameter difference cannot be kept like this. Best would be to go for the same sized tire on the affected side, so all are of the same profile.",,
"I have a Civic 99 Automatic. The Issue I am facing for the last few weeks is when it is moving above 100, and I push the pedal, and it reaches around 120, suddenly the speed drops as if the car was put it neutral.

"My Honda Civic oriel 03 is experiencing braking issues. While driving or idle i feel the brake pad is a bit spongy. when the car's engine is off then i feel nothing like spongy rather it feels as if it has been locked. 2nd issue is the sound of grrrrr even on a speed breaker where no emergency brakes are applied. i have done brake service but to no avail. i got my car's tyres installed in 2011, still they are in very good condition. please guide me","Your concern with the braking issues in your Honda Civic Oriel 03 has various potential explanations. The sensation of a spongy brake pedal could be a normal characteristic, with the initial inch of brake application being softer before the pedal becomes harder, particularly in newer models. When the engine is off, the pedal feeling locked is a standard response as the hydraulic pump is inactive. The grrr sound, especially on speed breakers, might be attributed to the ABS system kicking in to prevent tire slipping during hard braking or on uneven surfaces. One recommendation involves changing the brake oil with a fresh one and bleeding the air from the system to address potential issues. Additionally, the grrr sound could be associated with inferior brake pads, so replacing them with higher-quality ones is suggested. It's advisable to rule out emergency brake concerns, as these explanations provide insights into potential causes and solutions for your braking issues.",,

However, he seems to only work on Range Rovers and Jaguars and can't seem to fix a Corolla. I can assure you that the owners of such vehicles are foolish enough to send their cars with a driver to this person. The drivers get bribed for every repeat visit. I can assure you that he has no clue about the number of ground points in a Range Rover or the correct wire gauge for any given location. He just thinks that as long as there is a wire, it should work. This auto electrician is a complete idiot.  -  - I had a short trip to Islamabad after Eid in April and my neighbor was complaining about his Range Rover. He said that it wouldn't start and the workshop suggested towing it there for inspection. I was shocked because it was a 2018 limited edition with only 79,000 km on the odometer. I went to his porch and asked him to lift the hood. He didn't even know where to open it from and told me to figure it out myself. I placed the key on the driver's seat and opened the main red breaker in the engine bay. I flipped it to green and the dashboard came to life. On the third crank, the engine started. My neighbor was completely speechless and shocked. I left him there to figure out what I had just whispered to myself. (If only he had bothered to educate himself and read the user manual, he would have found all this diagnostic information there, idiot!)",,

"My serpentine belt broke while being driven by my driver today. The driver drove the car for around 10KMs after the belt collapsed. The AC stopped working, the car heated up and is now parked.

In your case, it seems that the oil pan from the F18B (CF3) might be causing the discrepancy in oil capacity. The best solution would be to repair the original H22A oil pan by removing dents and welding any cracks. If you can find a correct oil pan, it would ensure that the oil capacity aligns with the standard specifications for the H22A engine. Keep the oil level on the dipstick within the recommended range, even if it requires more oil due to the specific oil pan design.",,

"Hello, This is my first thread on Pakwheels, and I have recently had the engine of my 2006 Alto VXR overhauled. It has only been driven for 200km since then. The fan of my car is directly connected, and the temperature needle rises to the mid-level on highways. I want to know if this level of heating is normal or if there is an issue with overheating.","Assalamu Alaikum! Welcome to Wheels!Masail For your Alto VXR 2006 with a recently overhauled engine, the mid-level temperature on the highway is generally normal. However, if the radiator fan is directly connected, it's recommended to wire it back to automatic mode. Additionally, installing a thermostat is advised to regulate the engine temperature effectively. Ensure the radiator is cleaned, and consider using quality coolant like Caltex. While adding coolant, double-check that there's no obstruction in the radiator. Lastly, during the break-in period, it's generally advisable to avoid high speeds. Keep it moderate, gradually increasing the speed to let the engine components settle in properly. If you encounter persistent overheating issues, consult a reliable mechanic for a thorough check.",,
"I am researching about headlights upgrade in our 2019 Altis 1.6. We have had a big crash in the past due to poor lighting on the road. The options I see are: Buy Grande headlights. However, at 90k per headlight (180k in total), it is unaffordable. Simple bulb replace with SMD or HID. This is unethical as we will blind others and possibly damage the electronics + fire risk. Buy aftermarket projector headlights. I have been unable to find these; they are only available for 2014- 17 corolla. If anyone is selling for 2018-21 corolla, I would be interested. If anyone can tell me where to look for it, I will be very thankful. Also, would I also need a ballast and custom wiring with this? Retrofit projectors in existing headlights. This seems a little complicated for me. Does anyone offer these services including the supporting parts such as ballast, shroud, wiring harness etc. Someone is selling projectors from Grande for 12k. What supporting parts will it need? Will be very thankful for any help I can get. Regards","The weather conditions in the area are varied: visibility is low at H11, high at HB3, and there's fog at H8/16/11. Typically, H11 bulbs are used for fog lights, while HB4 bulbs are used for low beam headlights. For the low beam, an H11 bulb is required, while an HB3 9005 bulb is needed for the high beam. If you're considering replacing your headlights, you can opt for kabli Grande headlights, which cost around 100k-125k per pair. Alternatively, you could retrofit them yourself with assistance from KeiWorks, sourcing the necessary components like ballasts, bulbs, and projector lens, and then have them retrofitted by a professional.",,
I came across a person in Pindi who is going to start selling Hydrogen Fuel saving kits in cars to give upto around 35% savings in fuel consumption.He has got along with him some foreigners as well and they have installed kits on experimental basis in Islamabad last week on Saturday I guess.I asked him to provide me literature of the said product and the company's website so that I can check out full details but still havent got from him any details.He says that it will cost around Rs.44k.I checked on net and I got different kits with different prices available in US and Canada. Does this kit really work?And is it safe to install in vehicles? //MOD EDIT:  WARNING: Please note that the HHO fuel saving kit is a PROVEN SCAM and DOES NOT WORK. Pakwheels is NOT responsible if any member losses are incurred as a result of falling for this SCAM.  //,"While some consider the idea of using an HHO kit to generate hydrogen from water as workable with an educated approach, it's essential to exercise caution, especially considering our tendency to wash our cars' engines, electronics, and interiors excessively. However, there's a consensus that if the HHO kit is the type that claims to generate hydrogen from water, it's likely a scam, and it's advisable to protect both your money and your car. Despite some proponents arguing for its feasibility and cost-effectiveness compared to full electric conversions, skepticism remains due to the fundamental laws of thermodynamics. These laws apply universally, making it challenging to justify claims of efficiency or safety with HHO technology. While experiments may be conducted to test its efficacy, the scientific community generally remains skeptical about its practicality.",,
"Hi, I recently bought 2010 vitz. Somehow this great car doesn't have rear door speakers12 (strange).

Will only subwoofer be enough as front speakers sound quaily is amazing. Or should I somehow put couple of speakers at rear? Suggest me a good amplifier and subwoofer.

Will this kit be good for this car or its too big? Finally, as my car is 1.0 auto so will I need to put bigger battery in and do any alteration to alternator? Or will I need capacitor. Looking forward for your replies Nomi","It's essential to maintain balance in your car audio system, especially when adding a powerful subwoofer. Consider upgrading your front speakers to components and adding an amplifier and subwoofer in the back to maintain balance. Alternatively, you can opt for a small subwoofer with a built-in amp that blends well with your existing setup. If you're concerned about drilling holes in the back doors for speaker installation, explore options like aftermarket rear shelves. Additionally, avoid placing tweeters on the seat belt pillars; instead, install them on the A-pillars, dashboard, or kicks for better sound distribution. Some users have successfully installed additional speakers in their Vitz without compromising rear space, showcasing that with proper planning and installation, you can enjoy quality audio without sacrificing functionality.",,

Soo here is your solution if you dont need a sub but need a clean sound with good quality of bass then go for Hertz HSK-165 door components and a good Headunit or 4 channel amp i suggest Almani 4 channel amp it is best install 2 pairs of hertz components in doors and your sound will be best... as i know 1 pair price is almost 10-11k and 1 4 channel almani amp almost 8-9 K so your system costs around 34-35k with wirings but if you need a rear oval speakers on a wooden tray then you must have an amplifier... so get 2 pairs of original speakers sony speakers around 60watts rms costs 11-12k each pair and an amplifier.... your sound will be perfect..,,

Details Woofers, amplifiers sundown, rockford Component focal and rockford Twitters ds18 bullet","When discussing 0 AWG wiring, it's important to understand that it refers to a gauge size for electrical wiring, also known as 1/0 or one-aught wire. This wire size indicates a larger diameter wire capable of carrying higher electrical currents. The length of the wiring can be customized based on specific requirements, typically depending on the distance between the power source and the device to be connected. When choosing the type of wire, options include OFC (Oxygen-Free Copper) and CCA (Copper-Clad Aluminum). OFC is preferable due to its superior conductivity and durability compared to CCA, which may be more affordable but less effective over long distances. A typical 0 AWG wiring kit includes wire, connectors, terminals, fuse holders, and sometimes a fuse, necessary for proper installation and connection to audio systems or other electrical devices. Specific kit contents may vary by manufacturer. For more detailed information or specific inquiries, feel free to send a private message for further assistance. Additionally, one user mentioned using a Sundown amp kit with OFC wire for their setup, which included two X12 v2 d2 12-inch subwoofers, an SFB 8000 monoblock amplifier, a Rockford R300x prime 4-channel amplifier, Focal coaxial speakers, and DS18 bullet tweeters.",,
I heard it differs from car to car or make. I'm still figuring it out with my Corolla Se Saloon. Can anyone shed some light ?,"The amount of reserve fuel a car holds before the low fuel warning light comes on can indeed vary from one car to another. It's not only make-specific but also model-specific, and sometimes even within the same model, it can vary between different years. For example, in your Corolla SE Saloon, it may be helpful to refer to the owner's manual or contact the manufacturer to get specific information on the reserve fuel capacity for your particular model year. In general, the reserve fuel is a safety feature to ensure you have some fuel left for essential functions even when the low fuel warning comes on, and it's a good practice not to rely too much on it to avoid running out of fuel unexpectedly.",,

"Assalam o Alaikum Pakwheels, Dear all I have recently bought a Toyota Corolla Gli 2016 and looking to upgrade its sound system. It has company fitted speakers and a after market Chinese Android system installed. Looking forward for recommendations in Rawalpindi and Islamabad. I don’t need too much bass I am more inclined towards surround sound and better sound quality. I already own a amplifier and Subwoofer (Sony Xlod) from a previous car.","It all depends on your budget and preferences. You can start by listening to various car audio setups from members or visiting reputable shops like Soundvalley in Pindi Saddar. If you're in Islamabad, you can even demo my cars to see if you like the setup. Regarding amplifiers, if you have a 4-channel amp and prefer surround sound, focus on getting a good set of components for the front and rear coaxials, along with dampening the doors and rear shelf for better midbass punch. Alternatively, you can power the front components and sub through the amp and run the rear speakers through the Android unit, especially if it's a Chinese unit with limited power. Regarding speaker options, Infinity Alpha series is a budget-friendly and good sounding option. Be cautious of fake products; reputable shops like Soundvalley ensure authenticity. In Lahore, Soundworks is a good albeit pricier option, while Lazersound has had mixed reviews lately.",,

"During the running period of a fully or semi-overhauled car engine, several precautionary measures should be observed. These measures include: -  - 1) Speed Limit: It is important to adhere to a specific speed limit to allow the engine components to properly break-in. The specific speed limit may vary depending on the type of transmission (4 or 5-speed). It is recommended to follow the manufacturer's guidelines regarding this. -  - 2) Number of Passengers: It is advisable to limit the number of passengers during the running period of an overhauled engine. This helps reduce the load on the engine and allows it to adjust to the new components more effectively. It is generally best to keep the number of passengers to a minimum. -  - 3) Kilometer Limit: There is usually a recommended minimum distance (kilometers) that should be covered during the break-in period of an overhauled engine. This distance allows the new components, such as rings, valve seals, and gaskets, to properly settle and function optimally. It is essential to follow the manufacturer's guidelines and ensure that the recommended distance is covered before subjecting the engine to more demanding conditions. -  - It is important to note that these precautionary measures may vary depending on the specific car model and manufacturer. Therefore, it is always recommended to refer to the car's manual or consult with a professional mechanic for accurate and detailed guidance during the running period of an overhauled engine.","The mechanic's installation of oversized rings on polished cylinders and the addition of ""helper rings"" could lead to premature engine failure, as the rings require a rough bearing surface to properly mate with the cylinder walls, typically achieved through cylinder honing. During a correct engine rebuild or re-ring process, the engine should be started and allowed to fully warm up while checking for leaks and testing oil pressure. The mechanic should then gradually load the engine through various driving steps to seat the rings properly against the bore, ensuring they lose their rough edge. However, oil helper rings may sometimes cause issues, such as flooding the second compression ring with oil, resulting in cylinder wall polishing. Despite these initial steps, the engine should be driven normally. Running at 4000 rpm is not excessively high, but if the engine is running unusually cool without a thermostat or with the fan direct and lacks coolant, or if the tappets are left loose, it could indicate other issues. To address abnormal engine behavior, it's essential to drive normally, ensure the engine is perfectly tuned, and maintain proper operating temperatures. Following these steps, including running the engine only when fully warmed up and using the correct engine oil as specified in the owner's manual, are crucial for prolonging engine life.",,

"Rust proof your car for free The cause of automotive rust Most perforation rust (perforation means the rust has eaten right through the metal) starts from the inside of an automotive panel, not the outside. What you see on the surface is usually just the tip of an iceberg. Any observant motorist travelling overseas in a warm, dry climate soon notices the absence of perforation rust in the local vehicles. Obviously moisture is the major cause of rust. Moisture from dew, rain, or condensation becomes trapped for long periods in dirt crevices, especially along the bottoms of doors and around the inner edges of guards. Even without dirt, lack of factory paint can result in perforation rust, especially in car roofs due to condensation. Parking your car outdoors every night without shelter in rain and dewey nights can speed up this process three fold. So how how can you stop existing rust and prevent new rust long term? Preventing rust How often you have seen a rusty steel gearbox, or a steering knuckle? Or when was the last time you heard of a car engine sump rusting through? Most likely never. But these parts are all subject to moisture, salt etc, and are bare unpainted steel. Why don’t they rust? The answer is oil and grease. These parts tend to pick up a thin layer of oil or grease. Oil and grease repel moisture. Rust is not a living thing like cancer, it requires moisture to continue. Deprive it of moisture and it stops forming, or never begins in the first place. This is the basis of the free rust-proofing secret. Smear some oil or grease on a piece of metal and try washing it off with water. Virtually impossible without detergent. Whether the oil or grease is dirty or clean it still has this same property of repelling water and sticking to metal. So all you need do to ensure that existing rust does not continue, or ever take hold in the first place, is to treat the inside crevices of automotive panels with oil or grease. Oil is easier to work with and has the added advantage of continuing to creep deep into crevices and cracks for months afterward. Don't waste money buying new oil. The oil drained from the engine or transmission of your car will work fine. Most garages will fill a can for you if you don’t like to change your own oil. How to do it Using oil for rust proofing must of course be left until after any intended rust repair and painting is completed, or the adhesion of filler and paint will be seriously affected. (If you want to stop rust in the meantime, etch paint primer both sides will generally do the job, and also provide an ideal key for filler on the outside.) A paintbrush is usually all that is required to apply oil to the insides of doors and other easily accessible panels. But some areas will require a bit of ingenuity. A spray-gun can be useful. However most oils will need to be thinned 10-15% with kerosene in order to spray. You can buy an accessory for the Wagner airless electric spray gun that consists of a long thin plastic 6mm (¼ inch) tube with a tiny spray nozzle in the tip. These are ideal for rust proofing hard to get at places like inside sills (the two bottom panels that run along below the doors) and roof edges. Just drilling a hole in a concealed area to gain access is all that is required Whichever method you use, don't worry about overdoing it. Saturation is the key word. Surplus oil will find its way out, just be careful where you park the vehicle for a few hours. Oil may continue to seep out of cracks and drainholes for days afterwards but normally does not drip and can easily be wiped off with a rag. Sills can be difficult to treat. Sometimes kickplates or carpet can be removed and holes drilled, or cut with a chisel, and a spray gun used (see above). If this fails, a professional rust-proofer can treat them for you. In easily accessible areas such as boot floors, or where a dry finish is desirable, etch priming and painting both sides of a panel can be the best solution. Exterior crevices Deep exterior crevices which are sometines found around windscreens etc, trap salts that can cause surface rust. This is especially noticeable in vehicles exposed to sea winds, or in areas subject to heavy air pollution. A simple way to prevent this type of rust is to fill these crevices with grease. The firm water resistant type designed for marine use is best. For a cleaner finish you can use a clear or black silicon. (Use masking tape along either side of the crevice when applying for a neat finsh.) If rust has already started, a combination of both can be used. Make sure the crevice is dry, then forcing in oil or grease deeply to saturate the rust and deprive it of moisture. Then thoroughly clean and dry the surface area and apply a thin layer of silicon to seal it in. Again use masking tape to keep a clean edge. Welding in new steel versus filling? Most motorists believe that the only effective way to rid their vehicles of rust is to weld in new steel panels. This is effective if the new metal is butt welded, ie, welded edge to edge to existing panels without any overlapping. However this is seldom done as it is too time consuming and costly. What usually happens is that the new panels being welded in are overlapped with the old and then the edge of the new panel welded on the outsid only. This however sets up ideal conditions within the overlap for continued rusting, and also makes it difficult if not impossible to rust proof effectively. The chemical reactions of welding can also chase rust along even faster. Often within two years the rust is showing through again. Whereas filling the rusted areas with a good quality water-resistant filler, applied over an etch primer or sound paint, not bare metal and rustproofing afterward can result in a permanant repair. However for areas that are too big to fill, or require the strength of steel, welding panels is the only option. If a long lasting repair is required, only butt welding should be used. Rustproofing should be rechecked and if necessary retreated every two years.",an alternative to rust proofing is to buy an all aluminum defender...,,
"Rust proof your car for free The cause of automotive rust Most perforation rust (perforation means the rust has eaten right through the metal) starts from the inside of an automotive panel, not the outside. What you see on the surface is usually just the tip of an iceberg. Any observant motorist travelling overseas in a warm, dry climate soon notices the absence of perforation rust in the local vehicles. Obviously moisture is the major cause of rust. Moisture from dew, rain, or condensation becomes trapped for long periods in dirt crevices, especially along the bottoms of doors and around the inner edges of guards. Even without dirt, lack of factory paint can result in perforation rust, especially in car roofs due to condensation. Parking your car outdoors every night without shelter in rain and dewey nights can speed up this process three fold. So how how can you stop existing rust and prevent new rust long term? Preventing rust How often you have seen a rusty steel gearbox, or a steering knuckle? Or when was the last time you heard of a car engine sump rusting through? Most likely never. But these parts are all subject to moisture, salt etc, and are bare unpainted steel. Why don’t they rust? The answer is oil and grease. These parts tend to pick up a thin layer of oil or grease. Oil and grease repel moisture. Rust is not a living thing like cancer, it requires moisture to continue. Deprive it of moisture and it stops forming, or never begins in the first place. This is the basis of the free rust-proofing secret. Smear some oil or grease on a piece of metal and try washing it off with water. Virtually impossible without detergent. Whether the oil or grease is dirty or clean it still has this same property of repelling water and sticking to metal. So all you need do to ensure that existing rust does not continue, or ever take hold in the first place, is to treat the inside crevices of automotive panels with oil or grease. Oil is easier to work with and has the added advantage of continuing to creep deep into crevices and cracks for months afterward. Don't waste money buying new oil. The oil drained from the engine or transmission of your car will work fine. Most garages will fill a can for you if you don’t like to change your own oil. How to do it Using oil for rust proofing must of course be left until after any intended rust repair and painting is completed, or the adhesion of filler and paint will be seriously affected.

A paintbrush is usually all that is required to apply oil to the insides of doors and other easily accessible panels. But some areas will require a bit of ingenuity. A spray-gun can be useful. However most oils will need to be thinned 10-15% with kerosene in order to spray. You can buy an accessory for the Wagner airless electric spray gun that consists of a long thin plastic 6mm (¼ inch) tube with a tiny spray nozzle in the tip. These are ideal for rust proofing hard to get at places like inside sills (the two bottom panels that run along below the doors) and roof edges. Just drilling a hole in a concealed area to gain access is all that is required Whichever method you use, don't worry about overdoing it. Saturation is the key word. Surplus oil will find its way out, just be careful where you park the vehicle for a few hours. Oil may continue to seep out of cracks and drainholes for days afterwards but normally does not drip and can easily be wiped off with a rag. Sills can be difficult to treat. Sometimes kickplates or carpet can be removed and holes drilled, or cut with a chisel, and a spray gun used (see above). If this fails, a professional rust-proofer can treat them for you. In easily accessible areas such as boot floors, or where a dry finish is desirable, etch priming and painting both sides of a panel can be the best solution. Exterior crevices Deep exterior crevices which are sometines found around windscreens etc, trap salts that can cause surface rust. This is especially noticeable in vehicles exposed to sea winds, or in areas subject to heavy air pollution. A simple way to prevent this type of rust is to fill these crevices with grease. The firm water resistant type designed for marine use is best. For a cleaner finish you can use a clear or black silicon. (Use masking tape along either side of the crevice when applying for a neat finsh.) If rust has already started, a combination of both can be used. Make sure the crevice is dry, then forcing in oil or grease deeply to saturate the rust and deprive it of moisture. Then thoroughly clean and dry the surface area and apply a thin layer of silicon to seal it in. Again use masking tape to keep a clean edge. Welding in new steel versus filling? Most motorists believe that the only effective way to rid their vehicles of rust is to weld in new steel panels. This is effective if the new metal is butt welded, ie, welded edge to edge to existing panels without any overlapping. However this is seldom done as it is too time consuming and costly. What usually happens is that the new panels being welded in are overlapped with the old and then the edge of the new panel welded on the outsid only. This however sets up ideal conditions within the overlap for continued rusting, and also makes it difficult if not impossible to rust proof effectively. The chemical reactions of welding can also chase rust along even faster. Often within two years the rust is showing through again. Whereas filling the rusted areas with a good quality water-resistant filler, applied over an etch primer or sound paint, not bare metal and rustproofing afterward can result in a permanant repair. However for areas that are too big to fill, or require the strength of steel, welding panels is the only option. If a long lasting repair is required, only butt welding should be used. Rustproofing should be rechecked and if necessary retreated every two years.",Any area where water collects and is stopped that area is prone to rust.,,

Appreciate any input!","Take this with a grain of salt as nowadays people are complaining that Im blunt/rude etc. - but I have painted/refinished cars myself there are tons of cheap and fake stuff available which can bite you. This is why you need to find a good supplier. Secondly the air compressor you are using should be large enough to not short cycle constantly and you should have a very good moisture separator so you are not shooting water with the paint. The paint gun should be learned so the amount of spray can be dialed to the person handling the gun. A cheap gun results in bad finish. Use correct techniques to prep the paint including pepper coating to see the high and low sanding areas. Spraying it is also an issue as its easy to shoot dry spray which will result in a dead finish. Buy some mixing cups with measurements and ratios printed on the side of it and follow the manufacturer specs of the clear coat and its catalyser to get the correct ratio - do not try to ""andaaza"" it - it never works. (been there done that) - 3 wet coats of standox 2K clear will give you a very good finish provided you have sprayed the base correctly and evenly with a 30% overlap. Tape/disconnect/remove anything you can to get a clean/crisp finish everywhere. lastly - be safe, painting a car is hazardous to your health and can kill you so buy a respirator. Do not try to be He-man and commando the job with andaaza and no calculations or no safety. If you or your painter dont care then you might as well burn your money in a pile.",,

Please share your experiences.","the zinc content reduction was solely done for purpose of not killing the ""kitty cat"" in the exhaust, this created many issues and along the way many manufacturers went to roller assembly like rockers - e.g. GM flat tappet engines are ancient now, even in the old API SG days, most american engines had hydraulic lifters in OHV engines (infact being lazy - they (GM) kept on using the damn things). As engine tech goes further - development in the gasoline engine arena has taken a few leaps n bounds - almost all engines now employ either bucket over valve, roller rocker (inverted or straight doesnt matter) - smaller high pressure bearing surfaces etc. (Pakistan is still using 40 or even 50 year old engine technology) such old school oils while they are easy to buy in Pakistan and are cheaper - they are incredibly hard to find in other countries due to being obsolete and also to somewhat protect the interests of the manufacturer (idiot car owners will pour it in and wonder why the eff their cats are dead in half the time - while the federal warranty of a cat converter in a brand new car in USA is 7 years). as ahsanzs said - a cheap econo engine is pretty worthless if it takes a Rs 20,000/- oil change. So why challenge the situation. I personally think that if you operate the machinery under control specification and dont find an issue with longevity or performance then leave it alone. Only go about looking for other solutions when your control specification is either bad or cannot be implemented any longer (e.g. oils not available)",,

Its cam is not aggressive but does have flat tappets non the less and strong valve springs too. It does face the brute forces of the valve train due to which such oils were blended. Cat converters have been employed even in engines specifying API SJ oils and some even SH (infact havoline motor oil when first launched in Pakistan had that written proudly that it is perfectly suited for cars with cat converters - which half the population of Pakistan did not know what it was despite being in all the darling EE-80, EE 90 corollas with 2E-LU engines..

Mere observations I have. Well baleno was in production till 2005, so the manual is pretty outdated. If baleno had been under production now then definitely it would have had api sm or sn as requirement in the book. Cultus efi has the same technology and I never found the api requirements on the book. Probably the latest and best api grade should be used. People add zddp packs to api sn oils because they have been using muscle cars or classic engines. I am sure our flat tappet suzukis dont undergo that much strain or pressure. So api sm and sn should be fine. Above all, u can see that delo is also now api sL. In a matter of time, they will be available in api sn too. So the outdated api grades such as sL, sj or sg will be off the shelves soon, toh suzuki owners will inevitably have to shift to api sn or sm Please check your placement on the map - I beleive its Pakistan. there are no safety or emmissions mandates in that country - meaning there is no one to check exhaust emmissions or even vehicular safety. the reason to remove such high pressure additives was to save the cat converter from dying early, As it created another host of problems, most (sensible) manufacturers employed different technologies to remove the high pressure areas in their engines (roller cams, bucket/shim/hydraulic/solid tappets etc) - Pakistan has no mandate to have a cat converter - infact this very forum has a ton of threads of people advising to remove the cat because it affects ""parfarminss"" of their econocar. your beloved cultus efi has the same old ancient ""buzurg"" G series suzi 4 cyl engine that we have been seeing since we were roaming around in shorts, it still uses a soft cam and silly rockers with a pretty silly breathing setup aka, choked design - meaning rev more. Be assured that ancient API - SC, SE, SG, SH, SL - CH4, CI and CJ oils are not going anywhere from shelves in Pakistan, the insane numbers of Honda CD70E and CG125E and ancient mazda and bedford diesel engines in Pakistan will fail catastrophically in short time.

"Can anyone who is familiar with tools and ratchets, and general car maintaince stuff tell me what brand I should go for that is easily available in Pakistan. Which brands have good quality socket sets or what should I look before buying one.","Snap on tooling is not for diy level at all, just one socket goes for about 30 dollars a piece. A spanner set gets upto 500 dollars. Elora is a good brand and is available but their ratchets are garbage because they have thicker teeth count, you can look for koken and nikki tools, some sellers have ancient old stock for sale. A tool should be chunky and heavy and should not flex if its correctly hardened. (Chrome sockets), black impact grade sockets are softer.",,

You should have some 12 sided stuff too for some specific conditions like oldschool honda flywheel bolts. Good luck. Some brands I remember in pk were tony or king dick, one brand I forgot its name was actually from Czech republic, they looked very rough and thick but were incredibly durable and very heavy, you attach a 1/2 ratchet to it and your pinky could undo the bolts. My favorite werr elora and gedore/hazet but they were pricey.",,

Cheap sockets will have rough edges and will not be tight fit on nut/bolt, same with screw drivers while ratchets will feel loose and the clicking noise would be different. This can be my opinion only. When you start using tools you will differentiate them easily.",,

If you think this post can help, you can download and try the Honda DVD Satellite Navigation System. It was released in 2014 and the version is 3.80. The disc includes countries from Eastern Europe and Western Europe. The supported languages are English, German, and Italian. This system is compatible with various Honda models including Legend, Accord, CR-V, Civic, CR-Z, and Insight. The Honda 2012 Satellite Navigation DVD V3.80 offers updated maps that provide information on routes, new roads, detours, petrol stations, hospitals, restaurants, and other facilities. It is recommended to use WinRAR version 4.0.1 or higher to unzip the files and ImgBurn 2.5.4.0 or later version to record the DVD. It is also important to use a VERBATIM DVD+R DL disc with a maximum write speed of 4X. After recording, make sure to check the contents of the disk for any errors. During the update process, the engine should be kept on permanently. Insert the recorded disc and the update process will start automatically. If it doesn't, follow the steps mentioned.

The feed from HU goes to the amp via the RCAs and then to the speakers .. If the technician has used the speaker wires to feed the amp then there is no way you will be able to control the sub independently.. So I suggest you go a person with proper knowledge and get the wiring done properly.,,
"One of our cars is parked a lot, 10-15 days at a time between uses and we keep getting Low battery warning. Thinking of getting a battery charger to top up the battery each week to avoid battery damage. Can someone recommend a high-quality battery charger?","None of the locally available battery chargers are any good. Even Chinese ones aren't that great. Lead acid batteries require very precise voltages to charge, and go through bulk, absorption, and float charging stages. Bulk charging is constant current, absorption is constant voltage (14.4V - 14.7V) and float is 13.20V, with temperature-dependent voltage compensation. If you examine a locally-sourced charger, you'll find they don't have nearly enough components to monitor or manage these variables. Also note that your car battery is not a ""deep-cycle"" battery, meaning if you're letting it get very very low, it can only handle about 10-15 full discharge cycles before it irreversibly loses capacity and becomes unserviceable. However, SIMTEK, I believe, makes a 12V battery charger that may be decent. I have not examined one myself, but I own a SIMTEK UPS that has decent construction and quality components. Good quality imported chargers such as the Noco Genius may be available abroad. You might be served well by a battery ""tender"" - a trickle charger that keeps the battery topped up.",,

By profession, I am an IT professional, so with the time I get to spend on computer I started making myself knowledgable about car detailing, participating in international forums, the various sorts of products that are out there from all vendors and which combos are best suited for different color categories, identifying my wish list (if and when anyone travels that can bring it along) and how it all fits into the picture end to end. While some of you have seen my detailing posts from time to time and provided great feedback, I decided to create a thread of my own so that my information is in one place and that I can actually organise this thread with information/car details in one place. This isn't a thread to compete with the parent detailing thread and I will continue to be a part of it like I have always been.

I was already undergoing a project on my BMW E39 but it needs a lot of time and tbh, a lot of money too, therefore, I thought of pausing it for a while, meanwhile, I have started working on this Honda Civic EK3. The specs of this specific car are listed below . Powered by a Honda D15A SOHC motor . Stick shift . Nothing fancy except for the mesh grill and the front bumper lip . 15"" Vossen replicas .

Hope you all are doing great, this is going to be my 5th project that I'll be documenting on pakwheels but 11th in general. I was in search of the perfect budget V8 that I could use on a daily basis and maintaining it wouldn't be a pain in the ass. A car that I can drive everyday but enjoy on weekends. This is our 8th german but this E39 holds a special place in my heart as this is the first BMW that I bought from my own earnings. Coming to the specs, let's … Subscribe to my YouTube channel for some dope episodes of this build! www.youtube.com/abdulmunimqadri6 Here are the pictures of the car To chalein jee, BISMILLAH to another project car, stay tuned, guys!",Seems like a tight fit.

"I had my first bicycle when I was in the 1st grade perhaps, it was a BMX and my younger brother hand one as well but in a different color. As time passed by the bicycles kept on getting swapped or replaced as my parents believed it was an essential activity for kids. The last time I could remember riding a bike was in my matriculation period during which I used to ride back and forth to school and other places. Well now after a long break I have somehow re-developed an interest in building myself one. I went to the market and did an extensive research and there were many many brands chinese mostly and then there were used japanese one that were more expensive then new chinese ones. Luckily bicycles have tons of parts around and one can build one up-to their liking. I asked a friend who had one imported from Dubai(Japan Made, brand unknown) parked in his warehouse for a long time and he was generous enough to give it away. Even though I made him a promise that I wont spend much on it but I want to do it my way so stay put and enjoy the journey. The bicycle has been neglected and to add to the misery someone tried to paint it with a rattle can in silver destroying it’s beautiful skyblue finish, it is a bit rusty and sad but by the time I am done it will be a different machine iA. I asked them to disassemble it so that I can fit it inside the boot of my car so that I can move it around. Some pictures for reference.","Extremely rare to see a bicycling enthusiast. Good luck with the restoration. Most of the year the weather in our country is inhospitality hot which is not conducive for cycling. Only in winter can a person cycle for pleasure. In addition, unruly traffic and poor roads also discourage cycling for pleasure or exercise. It's a pity but that's how it is. Though millions of under privileged people cycle to and from work daily in Pakistan in all types of weather. Hats off to them.",,

It’s a diamond in the rough at-least that is how I see it Going to replace 90% of the accessories with brand new ones. Will be getting the frame painted by a professional painter and some of it’s bits powder coated along with new tyres, de-railers, brakes, center-axle, paddles, gear/brake levers, cables and much more.

I am from Pindi, went to the local bicycle shops in the vicinity and took rates for various parts. I went to College Road as well which is considered to be the hub for bicycles. A shop keeper there told me to go to NeelaGumbad in Lahore as it one of the biggest wholesale markets for bicycles in the country. By luck I visited Lahore this weekend and visited the place and believe me the mashwara that person gave me was the best. There was a day and night difference between the rates which amazed me and I made a deal with one of the bicycle shops there. Got all the partssss 1. Tyres: Got Service Mountain Bike tyres and BMX brand tubes  2. Front crank set  3. Front and back de-railers  4. New Chain  5. Aluminium Paddles  6. Side stand  7. Grips  8.

"Hi Users! So I took my Honda City 2015 to Honda Margalla. The car was initially tripping the AC after speed was 100kph, and this only happened once the car was in motion for 1-1.5 hour. The AC will then come back on with a hissing sound if I reduced the car to 70 80 kph and will not go off till I crossed 100 105 once more. This went on 2-3 trips on motorway. Then on one such ride the car started flashing overheating at 120+ initially which would go away if speed reduced. I checked, radiator coolant was 100% and both fans were working. Also, the AC tripping issue persisted. With this issue, I took it to HM. There was no error on the computer attached. They said they will first flush the radiator for overheat issue. They did and said the diagnostic showed no errors, and said should not heat up. (I believe this was not needed now, but at that time I consented). Then they told me (showed me) that the car only had 115 gm of gas, and topped it up. AC was fine (barring the trip thing imo) earlier but now after refilling gas it is super chill. Like ice cold chill. Here is a copy of my bill 18.5K basically. What do you think? How much/ what did I gain/lose from taking it to Honda 2S.","That location is close to Dani's workshop.

Which is justified as honeywell USA is also 22rs per gram at our workshop. But mentioning pakwheels would allow you to further get discount on it. However Radiator wash is something not justified and I don't believe any such phenomenon of Radiator wash. And this was not required because ac compressor has heat sensor In it and once not tripped it pops up the light aswell. So only refrigerant top up would have fixed your issue... The dealership has this habit of replacing everything without identification of the root cause of the problem. However what's done is done now.,,

How much/ what did I gain/lose from taking it to Honda 2S.",did they refilled it honda coolant? i dont see bill for the coolant,,
"Hi Users! So I took my Honda City 2015 to Honda Margalla. The car was initially tripping the AC after speed was 100kph, and this only happened once the car was in motion for 1-1.5 hour. The AC will then come back on with a hissing sound if I reduced the car to 70 80 kph and will not go off till I crossed 100 105 once more. This went on 2-3 trips on motorway. Then on one such ride the car started flashing overheating at 120+ initially which would go away if speed reduced. I checked, radiator coolant was 100% and both fans were working. Also, the AC tripping issue persisted. With this issue, I took it to HM. There was no error on the computer attached. They said they will first flush the radiator for overheat issue. They did and said the diagnostic showed no errors, and said should not heat up. (I believe this was not needed now, but at that time I consented).

Like ice cold chill. Here is a copy of my bill 18.5K basically. What do you think? How much/ what did I gain/lose from taking it to Honda 2S.","A/C gas charging amount is almost okay +/- .. what did they flush the radiator with is another story.. otherwise radiator service costs somewhere around 1500- 2000 rupees , but since they flushed it with something maybe that's why they charged 10500 .. A/C behaves abnormally due to over or underfilled gas, so that's correct when they told you they'll top up the gas... now check for overheat issues, if that's also resolved.. i think you dodged hitting a big hard rock that they didn't tell you since your car overheated you need to replace head gasket : )",,

A good freind of mine had a similar one like yours except his was black with red stripes. He was a crazy person like me so to tackle this problem of broken clutch cable he made the primary cable wire longer and had a split metal spacer bush that was attached to his keychain, he would insert the thing between the lever adjuster and cable body to make the cable taught. So it worked perfectly, When removed the lever went completely dead from the slack of the cable because the inner wire was too long - he never had broken clutch cables after that. I also did some strange stuff - like make a clevis for the kickstand for my yamaha, that clevis actually held the spring to the stand but was bolted aft of the axle point of the stand, this way when the stand was unloaded - one touch from your foot would send the stand home to folded position. The service table was a ""takht"" on which a rug and ""gaao takiya"" is placed in old homes - in this case it held up bikes on top and had tool drawers under it. While I could sit on a chair to repair them.",,

The usual complaint of the Kawasaki owners was the clutch feeling limp if the twin cable setup was used. For some reason these two simple springs were ommited - I dont know why.",,

Ducati at one time had such a setup but its pretty clever, The arm that would kick the stand upwards was made such that it only contacted the stand once the bike was upright and the stand unloaded - with bike on stand position the arm would not contact the stand and just swing past the pin of the stand. This ensured your cable never broke. The problem with this setup was that if the system malfunctioned you could end up with a stuck stand and Ducati bikes which had this did not have the service stand (double stand)",,

Talk to the owner Shehryar that I (Mustafa) sent you. He'll tune the setup for you. The problem is, you're running the speakers from the stock headunit. If you had upgraded front speakers, you could have easily connected those to the amp too and that way, atleast the front stage would have matched the sub and you wouldn't feel the mids and highs getting drowned by the sub. The built in amps in stock headunits are not really that competent and factory speakers are pretty much useless when you push them since they're made of really thin flimsy paper with miniature sized magnets He'll also do the sound deadening for you. I'd suggest you install the Caliber sheets which cost around 2500 each. 1 sheet just for the trunk lid is more than enough but you can go with 2 if you really want to isolate it, including the black inner padding",,
"Okay, so I have been looking for information regarding Genuine Toyota Oil Filters, specifically for 1NZ-FE engine. There are two variants: Part No. 90915-10003 Made in Japan (costs 800 Rupees from genuine part dealers/about 1200 from Toyota 3S) This is the same part no. as Toyota catalog for Axio Part No. 90915-YZZE1 Made in Thailand (costs about 400 Rupees from genuine part dealers)  I have mostly seen Thailand made oil filters in oil change shops. They give option of Leppon filter but I was not given an option of Japanese Toyota oil filter. The main difference between the two seems to be the element inside, pressure plate and relief valve. Thai made is cheaper, probably because it is sort of a paper? and I suspect it will be prone to holes. I intend to dissect the oil filter once I go for next oil change to see what has happened to it. I am really interested in knowing the exact technical difference between the two. Whether it is safe to use the cheap Thai made oil filter, still a Toyota product for 5000 km interval. Other things like micron rating, by-pass valve setting, flow rate etc. of the two. So far I have only found one website, in Russian which has compared oil filters of different brands. The pictures attached here are all taken from the same website: Link-1212 Link-281 From Google's translation of the site, I understand that the Thai filter's pressure plate also serves as the relief valve i.e. no dedicated relief valve. (This obviously is another cost saving step) While on Japanese, the pressure plate is separate and relief valve is embedded within the filter element. Can someone please tell me the pros/cons of pressure plate serving as a relief valve as well?

Relief valve can be clearly seen there, the coil thing.  MADE IN THAILAND  Nothing embedded in filter media. Pressure plate to the right also serves as relief valve   Close up of the filter element  Thank you for reading the topic. Looking forward to gain knowledge about this from everyone who can participate.","that fibrous looking filter (japanse) is specified for sludge prone engines like the 1MZFE etc, It has a higher bypass pressure too, The other paper type is specified for all general purpose. For easy understanding the japanese filter will trap more particulate but fill up quick and then flush the particulate in the engine if the bypass opens, hence use a low viscosity high detergent oil. The other ZZ part number filter is like a regular filter, it has a bypass too, the bottom assembly holds a coil spring which unloads the element and causes the oil to short circuit out of the casing (bypass) There is another filter that comes in new toyota engines only, it has a very fine media in it I have not been able to buy it as spare part. The closest filter to it is this japanese one. Now go buy a leppon filter and cut it open, you will have your quality test.",,

There are two variants: Part No. 90915-10003 Made in Japan (costs 800 Rupees from genuine part dealers/about 1200 from Toyota 3S) This is the same part no. as Toyota catalog for Axio Part No. 90915-YZZE1 Made in Thailand (costs about 400 Rupees from genuine part dealers)  I have mostly seen Thailand made oil filters in oil change shops. They give option of Leppon filter but I was not given an option of Japanese Toyota oil filter. The main difference between the two seems to be the element inside, pressure plate and relief valve. Thai made is cheaper, probably because it is sort of a paper? and I suspect it will be prone to holes. I intend to dissect the oil filter once I go for next oil change to see what has happened to it. I am really interested in knowing the exact technical difference between the two. Whether it is safe to use the cheap Thai made oil filter, still a Toyota product for 5000 km interval. Other things like micron rating, by-pass valve setting, flow rate etc. of the two. So far I have only found one website, in Russian which has compared oil filters of different brands. The pictures attached here are all taken from the same website: Link-1212 Link-281 From Google's translation of the site, I understand that the Thai filter's pressure plate also serves as the relief valve i.e. no dedicated relief valve. (This obviously is another cost saving step) While on Japanese, the pressure plate is separate and relief valve is embedded within the filter element. Can someone please tell me the pros/cons of pressure plate serving as a relief valve as well? Here's what I am talking about, Japanese (pressure plate is to the right of filter, relief valve is embedded on top of the filter element):  Thai (nothing in the filter element, the pressure plate is also relief valve):  and some more detailed images  MADE IN JAPAN    Close up of the filter element. Relief valve can be clearly seen there, the coil thing.  MADE IN THAILAND  Nothing embedded in filter media.

If you use a nice synth oil like Helix Ultra 5w30 in your engine, it will scrub it clean and also stay in a thinner state at normal temperature. It wont lift the bypass that easily.",,

If you notice the original toyota filter does not employ full end caps on the media barrel and the bypass sits under leaf spring pressure against the canister. You would need to make an exact copy of that - which is pretty hard to do commercially if you wish to sell it as fake product in wholesale. You can shine a light to see the bypass valve and deduce its construction if its higher quality or not.",,

Dear experts. I am facing a a problem in the car that the operating temperature is not maintained properly. Thermostat is there and although the temperature needle starts moving up but when driving continuously the needle doesn't reach the middle (at optimum operating temperature). Needle even drops near to Cold mark when driving at high speeds on highways. The only problem which comes to mind is that thermostat is not closing properly but I removed the thermostat and installed a new Japanese one and still the issue is same. Also I checked both thermostats but placing them in hot water and saw both are working fine (opening and closing). Why the car is not able to maintain the optimum temperature? Due to this heater is also not working good. There is no overheating or coolant reduction issue otherwise.,Please make sure you use a pot that you wont use for food cooking purpose later on.,,

There is no overheating or coolant reduction issue otherwise.,you may need a different thermostat valve as in Suzuki Bolan - There is a likely chance that cluster gauge has developed some corrosion. 1988-1993 Swift was notorious for such error. 2 / 3 / 4/ 6 channel radiator will not make any difference. The coolant capacity of the engine channels remain unchanged. Thermostat will open / close only at the specific temperature. @Xulfiqar @VCheng @rajaatta @dani_kk @SER_GTR @nomi01 @hassan1991 @babarhyd please correct me if am wrong,,

There is no overheating or coolant reduction issue otherwise.,"Gents, do I understand correctly that even if a radiator with 2, 4, 6, or 8 channels and high coolant capacity is installed, the engine with a thermostat will still operate in the same way? For example, the valve will open at 88/92°C and the automatic fan will switch on/off at 98/93°C. I tried explaining this using a domestic geyser as an analogy in a local language, but I was unsuccessful. No matter how large the geyser is, the temperature setting of the gas burner thermostat is what determines how hot the water will be. As long as the gas supply to the burner is sufficient, it won't make any difference. Even if the burner runs for a longer period, it will consume more gas.",,

For blades - you can buy inserts easily - but if you or someone else have tampered with the metal spine of the blade - it will be useless, usually I see the hawkers bend the spine out of shape or twist the wiper arm for some reason, The best wipe action comes from the blade pressed down square from the centre and the blade should not be floppy on the arm - the wiper will chatter on the screen if its floppy - you can insert very thin plastic spacers on the sides of the clips of the blade piece to prevent chattering. I buy genuine heavy metal wiper blades from the shersha junkyard and only replace the rubber pieces if necessary, work like a charm",,

See how much it can rev being in powerband. Next your cams will be the restriction. If you face pre-detonation switch to one step colder plugs.

"Hello, using an 82 degrees Celsius thermostat instead of an 80 degrees Celsius thermostat in a car can have both advantages and disadvantages. -  - Advantages: - 1. Improved Engine Performance: A slightly higher temperature thermostat can help in achieving better engine performance as it allows the engine to warm up faster and reach its optimal operating temperature. -  - 2. Improved Fuel Efficiency: When the engine reaches its optimal temperature quickly, it can operate more efficiently, resulting in better fuel economy. -  - 3. Reduced Emissions: With a higher temperature thermostat, the engine can reach its operating temperature faster, which can lead to reduced emissions as the engine operates more efficiently. -  - Disadvantages: - 1. Potential Overheating: One of the main risks of using a higher temperature thermostat is the possibility of overheating. If the cooling system in the car is not able to handle the higher operating temperature, it could lead to engine overheating and potential damage. -  - 2. Increased Wear and Tear: Operating at a higher temperature for prolonged periods may result in increased wear and tear on engine components such as gaskets, seals, and other parts, potentially reducing their lifespan. -  - 3. Limited Cooling System Capacity: The cooling system of a car is designed to dissipate heat generated by the engine based on its specific operating temperature. Switching to a higher temperature thermostat might exceed the cooling system's capacity, resulting in inadequate cooling and potential overheating. -  - It's important to note that any modifications to the thermostat or cooling system should be done carefully, considering the car's specific requirements and manufacturer's recommendations. It is advisable to consult with a professional mechanic or automobile expert before making such modifications.","Wailaikum Assalam Rating written on the thermostat is the opening temperature of it. 82* means it will start opening after 2 more degrees then 80*. Thermostat takes time to fully open up. Engine's temperature will also stay above then 82* while cruising, which should be above then 80* or maybe 80*. In short engine will run 2 degree hotter in all situations. Oem systems are balanced. .",,

It does not make any noise apart from the normal spooling sound after 2 psi, develops 10psi under WOT, 7-9psi under moderate to heavy load. It behaves completely normally otherwise. I have a BOV installed instead of a diverter/recirc valve. I suspect it might be a gasket seal failure on either the intake or exhaust side of the compressor, vibrating and causing it to behave like a reed. Or is my turbo close to failure?","I'm in Karachi. If you have any legitimate references in Lahore, though, and I need to have my turbo worked on in the future, I'd be willing to ship it there.",,

Hi! Do you guys know any seller who can make this subwoofer available on demand. i tried sehgalmotors and shaharyar traders. they dont have it and they cant make it available on demand. Any help would be highly appreciated! TIA,"Have you considered slapping this guy? This isnt the only sub with a built in amp on the market. As a direct competitor, you can also opt for the JBL CS1214T. However, pre assemble subs are good for 1 thing only, space utilization. The only valid point he made was you can get another sub in a built box for a sedan's trunk. The ready to install L ported boxes available in the market are not tuned. If you are going for a spl setup, get a sub, build the right enclosure and watch it destroy a much higher rated sub in a generic box to pieces. If you are only getting the sub, the right kind of amp would be a mono or 2 channel on bridge mode. Just watch out for the RMS values of the amp. It should match or exceed that of the sub inorder to run that sub to it true potential And since you have a saloon, your bass will sound even better without your trunk rattling all over the place. Get 1 or 2 sound deadening sheets, cover the trunk and boot area and enjoy those highs and lows. Not the krrrrrrrr krrrrrrrrr and the clipping sounds",,

If your car batteries fail or electric system fail the EPS might shutdown and lockup steering and u cant move ur car until its repaired on the other hand if HPS oil leaks or pump fails u can still drive ur car to mechanic or ur destination. HPS steering box are very good because it uses steel bush so that not only makes it very reliable also low noise on bad roads.,,

Liquid coolant, heated by the engine, is funneled through the radiator, where it is cooled by heat exchange. Over time, sludge builds up inside the radiator and the... Which way should i go, imo the method by xulfiqar bhai seems good which involves removing the old coolant and adding a solution of citric acid, again removing that and topping off with new coolant.

Add water mixed with a radiator flush solution, such as LIQUI MOLY RADIATOR FLUSH. - 3. Drive the car for a couple of kilometers, preferably 100 km or more. - 4. Flush out the water with the radiator flush solution. - 5. Once again, add water mixed with radiator flush solution. - 6. Let the car run for about 10 minutes. - 7. Flush out the solution from the system. - 8. Remove the T valve and check its condition. - 9. Keep the T valve removed. - 10. Add distilled water along with any flush solution. - 11. Run the car for a few minutes, around 10-20 minutes. - 12. Repeat steps 10 and 11 until the water coming out of the radiator is clean. - 13. If necessary, replace the T valve. - 14. Top up the radiator with coolant. - 15. Check for any leaks. - 16. Make sure the car doesn't overheat and keep an eye on the temperature gauge. - 17. Enjoy your ride! -  - For coolant suggestions, it is recommended to avoid using expensive Honda coolant. Instead, try the Toyota Concentrated coolant, which is more affordable (priced between 900-1300 per liter). Mix it with distilled water in a 50/50 ratio or 1:1 ratio, depending on your preference. Remember to use distilled water only.",,

"We have recently rebuilt a Daihatsu Charade G-30 Diesel Turbo (CL-60) engine with partial success. Everything is changed except for head and crank. The engineering workshop guy gave its ceased turbo to someone for rebuilding. I trusted him and the result was pathetic. This rebuilt turbo FAILED within 2 hours of idling following first cold start after engine rebuild. Rest is fine, cold and warm starting are good, no heavy smoke at low to moderate RPM and it isn’t consuming engine oil anymore except for leaking turbo. Now someone has suggested me a workshop on Gawalmandi Road (Rawalpindi) near Kiani Autos who claims to be the specialist of turbo works. ** He told me that finding a new turbo of this engine is next to impossible, so he’d take the **kit from Suzuki Every Turbo variant and use it to rebuild Charade CL-60 Turbo with some alteration. He claims that this turbo would be as good as a new factory specs and would be long lasting. But the problem is, he is ONLY offering warranty of 2 days, if it fails within this period, it’s on him to redo the job but after that he won’t be responsible for any malfunction. 2nd option I have is to REMOVE this turbo which is going to eliminate the risk of failing turbo again. Since I use this car for shorter trips within city at much lower speed, deleting turbo may not adversely affect engine power and fuel economy. But you know this engine was designed to work with turbo so it may also shorten the engine life. So what would you suggest? Should this be REMOVED or REBUILT using Suzuki Every’s Turbo again? The latter option is like taking a gamble! Only professional and sincere advice needed, please don’t suggest me to scrap the engine as it has already been rebuilt and working fine except for this turbo leaking problem.","You can find a similar turbo cartridge from a lot of engines, a lot of kubota use the same IHI turbo cartridge as this one. Bigger question here is, during rebuild how did you proceed with the below points 1 did you find a new crank bolt? 2 did you use a torque wrench on that bolt? 3 what tool was used to tighten the head 4 is the pump from a turbo engine? (Has the boost compensation device? - does the pump increase fuelling under boost?) 5 how did you time the pump to the engine? 6 does the pump advance timing at 2000 engine rpm? 7 are the injectors set to pop at the right pressure? They pop at 1700 psi i recall. Its a 3 cyl diesel - anything causing a slight power problem per cylinder can wreck the engine quite fast.",,

"PERSONAL EXPERIENCE Three years back I got interested in analyzing the procedure which is used by battery maintenance shops. They purchase Sulfuric in drums and then mix it with tap water in 66 % by volume. They say that chemical reaction causes the water to boil which remove the oxygen molecules from the mixture hence results in giving up gravity of 1250 which they pour it in car batteries. Batteries run fine for year or two whereas I think if it is all about removing impurities from car batteries then they are making a mistake by adding tap water which would off course boil the water but would not guarantee the removal of impurities present inside the water. I have six batteries of 200 Amps each in my office which can support 15 computers during heavy load shedding. In order to overcome the Myth, I purchased a drum of Sulfuric Acid and have mixed it with distilled water which I have produced it in my own lab. I took all my batteries outside and have flushed it with tab water to remove all the deposits present inside the batteries. Flush was performed multiple times then batteries were refilled with Acid of 1250-1270 gravity prepared within my office compound. Since, electrolyte was prepared with distilled water and UPS was properly adjusted so even at the end of the third year my batteries are able to provide 90 % backup time as compared to the time of purchase, even after excessive load shedding of 1 hour?s; 5-6 times a day from last three years. Flush is a periodic exercise which is performed at least once a year also I have adjusted the output of my UPS to charge per battery at rate not more than 8 Amps. So basically the right ups settings along with a good electrolyte and distilled water prepared in my own lab used for topping up the batteries later made the difference. That?s is not something difficult as my entire intent is to educate my audience regarding these simple techniques which will give you years of trouble free service. NOTE: ELECTROLYTE GRAVITY IS ADJUSTED ONCE IN START, LATER YOU POUR DE-IONIZED OR DISTILLED WATER FOR TOPPING UP. CHANGE IN S.G LATER IN ANY CELL POINTS TOWARDS A PROBLEM AREA. AT THIS STAGE, YOU NEED TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE EITHER BY LOOKING AT UPS ADJUSTMENT, EITHER IT?S BECAUSE OF BAD ELECTROLYTE OR NEEDS A FLUSH. LESSONS LEARN: 1) If electrolyte is prepared with tab water then batteries will die much earlier than its actual life. 2) Wrong UPS settings is yet another major factor which contributes in killing your batteries much earlier. 3) With wrong combinations of both, you will start to experience problems with batteries within first three months. Having understood the issue, My two 220 AMP-HR batteries connected with my UPS at home powers the entire house lighting, fans and runs flawlessly without much reducing the electrolyte and backup time even after two years. HOW TO ADJUST UPS Most of us are using the similar local UPS sold in market. The only problem with these UPS is that they have few parameters which most of the times are not adjusted properly. Now once you buy these UPS then try to get it adjusted at shop before bringing it to your home. By rule of thumb the maximum allowable charging rate of Lead Acid batteries are its Amp Hour rating divided by 10. For 145 AH battery; the correct charging rate is 145 AH/10 is 14.5 Volts. Anything above this would be termed as fast charging which would damage your batteries in long run. Slow charging is good for batteries but if intensity of load shedding is frequent then probably batteries won?t be prepared before it enters next cycle of load shedding. So you need to look into your circumstances before adjusting this figure but in circumstances you should go above maximum allowable charging rate. You should always ask local UPS shops to adjust these parameters according to specification given below. If you are interested in learning them then ask him to do it in front of you. Mark those parameters with paper tape so that you don?t forget once you do it yourself. Also try to work these settings in your mind first so that you may directly dictate the electrician. These UPS have a PCB card which has many variables. These variables can be adjusted using a screw driver. During load shedding the Output of the UPS is much more than normal Voltage. Adjust the variables such that your Output Voltage should never exceed 265 Volts once batteries are fully charged and put into backup mode. Adjust such that once output voltage reaches 220 Volts then your UPS should trigger the alarm and should shutdown within 10 seconds. Adjust the charging rate of each battery such that (AMP HOUR rating divided by 10). E.g For 200 AMP-HR batteries, I can keep it somewhere closer to 15 Amperes but will never exceed 20 amperes. Slow charging is very good for batteries but look into your circumstances as batteries will take more time to charge its self and you need to the batteries to be prepared for next cycle of load shedding. UPS should stop charging your batteries once the output voltage two batteries connected in series reaches 28 Volts and for single battery UPS system, it reaches 14 Volts. This is termed as cutoff Voltage. During Load shedding, once output of batteries (where two batteries are connected in Series) reaches 21 Volts then Alarm should trigger and UPS must be shut down immediately. Also note the output of UPS at that instance as it should not be less than 220 Volts otherwise sensitive electronic equipments such as TV?s, computers and routers will start to restart its self. Always keep your UPS line separate from main line. Your UPS should shutdown immediately if load exceeds the maximum capacity. UPS shops have different bulbs installed on board with different Powers to adjust these settings on UPS system. Always test under full load so that you are aware about the maximum load your UPS can take. Now, your computers should be safe under these configurations. You will need a good quality Voltmeter and AMP meter. Since chemical properties of battery?s changes the entire year so you will have to check your tuning after every few months which you can easily do with help of a Voltmeter, Amp-meter & hydrometer. PREPARING ELECTROLYTE: I don?t recommend that you prepare the electrolyte at home as mixing sulfuric acid with distilled water produces a lot of heat which can severely hurt any individual. If you can buy the electrolyte of 1250 gravity from some company like PRYO chemicals then that?s a best possible scenario. Otherwise, follow below. HOW TO PRODUCE DISTILLED WATER It is very easy to produce distilled water at home. By distilled water we simply refer to the water which is heated then it changes its form into steam. Steam should be allowed to pass through some system where it can condense so that it may change its form back into liquid and this liquid can be collected in some separate container. This liquid will be free from all sorts of impurities and is called distilled water. I have used a pressure cooker, air conditioning coils, rubber pipes, two plastic containers one for dipping the coils into cold water so that steam inside the coil can change its form back into liquid and other end connected to rubber pipe so that now distilled water can be collected into a second plastic container. HOW TO MIX ACID WITH DISTILLED WATER Specific gravity is measured in (kg/cu.m) for your reference as I won?t be repeating these symbols during this topic afterwards. Water has a specific gravity of 1000 where as Sulphuric acid has specific gravity of 1800. Once you mix 66% (in volume) of distilled water in 34% (in volume) Sulphuric Acid then you should get a gravity of 1240. But normally you end up getting a gravity of 1400 as lot of distilled water is evaporated during this process due to heat being generated. You can make later adjustments using distilled water once Acid has cooled down as at that time no heat will be generated. Always remember that battery will show increased gravity once charged and reduced gravity once discharged. Initially aim for gravity of 1250 and then you can take the reading after a week and make fine adjustments by using electrolyte prepared earlier of 1400 gravity or 1350. Always pour Acid on distilled Water not distilled water on Acid. Wear Rough Clothes, Glasses and gloves if possible. Keep the Acid and Mixture out from the reach of Children. Lot of heat would be generated during this process so be very careful. Always Use plastic Container not Metal. Mixture will take minimum 24 hours to cool down. Never pour the mixture inside the battery once it?s hot. 64 % distilled water should be Mixed with 36 % Acid by Volume. You may end up getting a gravity of 1400. Keep hydrometer with you and only check once fluid has cooled down. You can perform later adjustments by pouring more distilled water on the mixture once it has cooled down and at that time no heat will be generated. Use Plastic bottles to store the mixture. Always Label it as ?Very Dangerous Sulphuric Acid with Gravity ABC ?. Keep it in safe place where no one other then you can touch it. Container used for producing the mixture should never again be used for taking bath. Don?t allow anyone to misuse the Acid for hurting anyone. HOW TO PERFORM FLUSH Procedure which I follow is that I fully charge my batteries, then take the batteries outside, drained the electrolyte in proper sewerage line while I already have an access to new electrolyte which was prepared earlier before performing this procedure and have the batteries flushed it with tap water 5-6 times. Later put the battery in upside down position for 30 minutes before pouring new electrolyte back in. DIAGNOSING ISSUES WITH UPS SYSTEM (BATTERIES AND UPS) KNOW YOUR SITUATION: Electricity outrage in Pakistan varies, sometimes after every 6 hours in few places and sometime after every hour for next three hours. UPS might be perfectly tuned but may fail to cope up with changing situation. Charging rate which may be properly set up for winter season or for few areas may not be able to cope up with high demand once electricity outrage will be more frequent. Under these scenario, first your ups may not be able to give desired performance and secondly your batteries may be exposed to damage which may result from remaining discharge for an extended period. It is very important that two variables must be properly adjusted on UPS, the first one is low cut off voltages and second one is the charging rate which may require adjustments as per the situation as highlighted above. LOW CUT OFF VOLTAGE: This variable is set to 10.3Volts and UPS should trip once voltage on battery terminals reaches this voltage. As extended discharging will surely damage the batteries very soon once voltage on battery terminal will drop below 10.3Volts. CHARGING RATE: this much be adjusted in accordance to your situation, you should know the maximum allowable charging rate, slow charging is good for batteries but once electric outrage is more frequent and for long duration then you should try to increase the charging rate till ups is able to charge the batteries within hour or two. For example, If you have two batteries of pheonix UGS 215, whereas the company?s wesite site says that its AMP-HR rating is 160AMP-HR and charging rate is set to 7Amperes then use the formula of maximum allowable charging rate AMP-HR/10 which in this case comes out to be: 160/10=16, try to increase the charging rate till 10 Amperes or 14 Amp but never exceed 16 Amperes. Then try to observe if next time UPS charges the battery in needed time or not and correspondingly you can make the fine adjustments. Charging rate is set by attaching the AMP meter on battery wire, then slightly turning the charging rate variable on PCB board while ups is still charging the batteries. Either it?s going to increase or decrease which you can easily see on amp meter. TWO MOST IMPORTANT VARIABLES: CHARGING RATE AND CUT OFF VOLTAGE People who says that their batteries dies within 3 to 6 months or they start to experience low backup time very soon then they should cross verify the cut off voltage at which charging stops and the charging rate. If your these two variables are set properly then your battery will not give you unexpected surprises and plus it has a good electrolyte then trust me, it will easily go above 2.5 years provided battery does not have any manufacturing fault. THINGS WHICH ONE SHOULD CONSIDER BEFORE BUYING A UPS SYSTEM AND SELECTING BATTERIES FOR IT. Imported ups will definitely will save you from many problems, as you won?t have to worry about cut off voltage at which charging stops, low cut off voltage at which ups should trip, load setting which indicates the maximum load which ups can take, output voltages if you want to run your TV or computers on ups but still people do make a mistake even once buying the imported UPS system. Which is that they don?t consider reading the maximum charging rate at which ups starts to charge the batteries and they correspondingly don?t select the correct battery. Most of the imported ups system starts to charge the batteries at 10-12 Volts which implies that you should never buy a battery whose AMP-HR rating is below 150 least. Charging rate on imported UPS are fixed and can?t be manually adjusted. Good thing is that it charges the battery at three different charging rates which corresponds to the voltages on battery terminals which is a desirable thing. IF YOU WANT TO RUN YOUR TV?S AND COMPUTERS ON UPS SYSTEMS: IMPORTED UPS Even if batteries are not in good health, imported ups will maintain the output voltage to 220 and would trip once batteries will discharge to a limit as set by factory. So we have no problem here. LOCAL UPS: But with local UPS systems, output voltage will drop once batteries are going to discharge. You should not set the output voltage of local ups to 220 volts once batteries are fully charged as by time once batteries will be completely discharge with voltage on battery terminal to be around 10.3 Volts then maybe your output voltage will drop to 160 to 180 Volts. That?s why it is important that output voltage maybe set to 250 or 255 volts so by the time once voltage on battery terminals should reach 10.3 Volts then output voltage may still be above 220 Volts. Otherwise, you will keep on experiencing burnt WIFI adopters, mobile charging adopters, wifi devices and TV?S. Output voltage on ups is adjusted by fully charging the batteries and removing every device off from its output just in-order to be safe. Then you need to insert the voltmeter in its output and adjust the output voltage to a desired value using the onboard variable. SOLAR INVERTERS, ON-GRID, OFF-GRID, BATTERIES COMPATIBILITY WITH INVERTER AND SOLAR PANELS   Not all solar inverters are compatible with solar panels or for matter of fact goes well with any sort of batteries may it be dry or lead acid batteries. Things will work, but will eventually ruin your battery bank very quickly for reasons discussed in thread below. It is very important that one carefully selects the inverter which is able to provide the correct voltage needed to charge the batteries. Things such as inverter allows you to wire few solar panels in series, your load, inverter type, how different systems are integrated with each other at battery level, what should be your total panels output needed to charge the batteries and simultaneously power the attached load such that it does not kills your battery bank or leave it uncharged is discussed and how could your replace your ups with hybrid solar inverter which means saving in terms of electricity bills due to UPS. I be happy to extend my experience and knowledge on subject matter either on thread below or on same thread. 13https://www.pakwheels.com/forums/mechanical-electrical/276598-diy-solar-panel-installation-controller-selection-batteries13 DISTILLED AND DE-IONIZED WATER SUPPLIERS I will start adding the locations and address of agencies which provide distilled and de-ionized water here. Right now one of the members (@stonedsaint) have provided this address and I have verified this by calling them as they are offering de-ionized water at Rs 9/Liter. You should take your bottle along with you otherwise they charge Rs 500 non-refundable for big plastic container.

Comments: Rs 9/Liter seems like a good deal. Pyrochem provides Electrolyte prepared with De-ionized water, those who are based in Lahore can contact them. Delivery Guy, according to one member @deltoid61 says that they may be able to provide in other cities. Pyrochem (Pvt) Limited, 96-Bank Square Market, Model Town, Lahore - Pakistan.

I do it all the time once I buy a new battery and @deltoid61 has reported the same on post no: 1298 WRONG FLUSH PROCEDURE AND PRACTICES I really find it hard to replay every one as people are making all sorts of mistake while making the flush and most of them are doing it blindly not knowing if it?s going to be successful or not. kindly judge before doing so and won?t be successful under the condition. You had been using dirty electrolyte right from start and batteries have gone bad or impurities are coated on the cells leaving very little active material behind. Batteries have died because of slow charging rate such that it enters into next cycle of load shedding without being properly charged or cutoff Voltage is badly set such as 27 Volts for double battery system. Or batteries are damaged because of overcharging such that one of the cells are now damaged. Or batteries have outlived its useful life and very less active material is left on the cells. You may perform flush You can still perform flush if you know batteries had the bad electrolyte and still all cells are ok and now you want to replace it with good one. Once charging rate, cutoff voltage is properly setup and you feel in-between that now backup time has started to drop and then do it immediately. MAIN REASON, LIGHT FLUSH IS PERFORMED. As the battery sheds its lead to the bottom of the container, a conductive layer forms, and once the contaminated material fills the allotted space at bottom of the battery and conductive material reaches the plates then creates a shorting effect and sometimes conductive material gets stuck between two plates creating a short and drains the battery fast. This condition only happens on a batteries which properly charges and discharges unlike batteries which never gets a chance to charge properly or die prematurely because of formation of sulfate crystals. Perform flush, once your charging system is properly adjusted right from start and you have noticed that backup time is dropping then immediately perform flush so that you can eliminate above factor by doing so. I have been successful number of times in restoring the backup time as I understand what I am doing. Even then you go ahead and perform flush without being successful then note that above factor was not responsible for reduced backup time. Do it before a damage has occurred as nothing you will do later will bring a bad cell back to its life. SPECIFIC GRAVITY AND PEOPLES CONFUSION Electrolyte specific gravity is an indicator which tells that batteries are good or bad. To make it simple, just like we use voltmeter to measure dc voltage on battery terminals and AC output voltage, we use amp-meter to measure the charging rate on batteries as these values helps us tune our UPS, the same way Electrolyte specific gravity measured with help of hydrometer tells us lot about how good your batteries are. It?s little tricky to draw conclusions out after reading the specific gravity so don?t start getting worried very quickly. So understand it this way, that you cannot answer few question by a single answer, same is the case with S.G reading. You need to consider following before drawing any conclusion. Specific gravity reading should always be taken on a fully charged batteries, as during discharging, sulfuric acid within electrolyte gets absorbed in cells whereas during charging sulfuric acid comes out to mix with the electrolyte within batteries so you will never observe a good value if you will take those readings on a fully discharged batteries, may your batteries have no issues and you may keep on getting worried for nothing. Once, new electrolyte is added in batteries (on new batteries or after flush) with ups properly tuned, then it takes approximately two weeks for batteries to show its true S.G value. This is because, the sulfuric acid content within the electrolyte is heavy and goes down to settle in bottom. Within repeated charging and discharging, it gives ample chance for both the contents in electrolyte which is sulfuric acid and distilled water to mix with each other. If you know, your UPS is properly turned then don?t get immediately worried after adding the electrolyte in batteries. Variation of SPECIFIC GRAVITY between different cells straightaway points towards a problem with one or with more cells. You can jump to the conclusion directly here. Kindly take into account, if I misquoted somewhere that if you need to increase the specific gravity then add electrolyte with higher specific gravity into it. Normally if electrolyte was prepared with right adjustments in start then you don?t need to do this throughout the life span of battery so always add distilled water if level of electrolyte drops later at any stage. Later if you see that all the cells are showing 1250 or 1230 specific gravity except one which is showing 1160 then that?s an indicator that this cell is bad. Adding electrolyte with higher specific gravity will not solve the problem. It?s up-to you, if you want to perform the flush or any other exercise which may recover the cell before it completely goes bad. ISSUE WITH BATTERY REPAIR SHOPS: INSTALLING NEW LEAD PLATES Analyze the issue, every battery designed or manufactured is on certain AMP-HR ratings that is dictated by cells cross section area, thickness and lead plates in every cell. Now if you have a 200 AMP-HR battery which you have given to the repair shop, then how do you expect that to attach the same numbers of plates in every cell that they will use the same cross section area and thickness depending upon the AMP-HR ratings? These repair people are mostly uneducated and they have standard plates which they fit in every battery thus this alters the original AMP-HR ratings. Once a battery which used to be off 200 AMP-HR rating was charged at 15 Amperes of current by UPS has now became maybe of 70 AMP-HR rating and has become unfit to be charged at the same rate. God knows, where they buy the lead plates from and what about its quality s and above all, I once got the job done from them on two of my 200 Amp-hr batteries and lead plates which they fit in were of a very small size as compared to what it came from factory originally. And they charged me RS 4000 for single battery, not worth the time and money to be wasted on it and above all it died within first two months with much reduce backup time. DEEP CYCLE BATTERIES VS ORDINARY STARTER LEAD ACID BATTERIES: Difference between deep cycle batteries and ordinary lead acid batteries are the plate specification, deep cycle batteries have been designed for UPS/INVERTERS, solar panels and to be used with wind turbines, have think plates and can considerably discharge to a lower limit such as 50% of the batteries capacity where as ordinary lead acid batteries can only be discharged to 80% then they would require charging again, have thin plates with large surface area and very good for cranking vehicles as it can deliver high voltage for a very short duration of time as needed for the application. So there is a tradeoff between cold cranking voltages and backup time. Recently I have seen phoenix batteries in Pakistan producing UGS series specifically designed for UPS/INVERTERS. Although, the site does not clearly labels its as deep cycle batteries but still should be preferred over ordinarily lead acid batteries because of thicker plate size as desired and will surely last for a longer time. I am sure, they will not try to rip people by increasing their price just for heck free publicity they are getting from here. DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 12 VOLT UPS AND 24 VOLT UPS: Many find this confusing, so you can understand this way that lead acid battery manufacturers develop batteries in 12Volt format, so now UPS manufacturer?s designs a system in-order to get connected to 12 Volt battery or two 12 Volts batteries connected in series to make it a 24 Volts system just in-order to double the backup time for those who desire such system. Connecting batteries in series doubles the voltage but AMP-HR rating for the system would remain same. Which just says that formula which is applicable for calculating the maximum allowable charging rate for 12 Volt battery bank will also apply to a 24 Volt battery bank. Let me explain this with example, if you have 160 AMP-HR battery connected with 12Volts system then maximum allowable charging rate for this case is 160/10=16, now if you have two 160AMP-HR batteries connected in series on 24Volt system then again maximum allowable charging rate will again be 16 amperes for this setup, it?s just that now you can run the same load for double the time on 24Volts setup. If novices does not wants to confuse himself, then don?t read further. You must be thinking that I can connect two batteries of same capacity on 12 Volts UPS system in parallel configuration which will also double the backup time. Then answer is that you are right, but here you will have to add up the AMP-HR capacities of both the batteries in-order to calculate the new maximum allowable charging rate and discharging rate. In parallel configuration with two 160 AMP-HR batteries, you can now charge your system at 32 amperes of maximum allowable charging rate as current divides in parallel configuration. So in short, if your 12 volts one battery could have lit maximum 15 of the energy savers for one hours than 24 battery bank can light the same for 2 hours. Now, once you will add two batteries in parallel on 12 Volts system then you can increase the number of bulbs to 30, can either lit those 30 for one hour or turn 15 off to light yet another 15 for two hours. Hope, you must have got it as I could not make it simpler this this. P.S: in above example, I have ignored the limitations imposed by UPS on a battery bank, like few have safety switches, which will go off if you will try to light 30 energy savers for 1 hour on 12 Volts system with two batteries in parallel. WHAT DOES 700W, 1000W AND 3000W UPS MEAN: I don?t think, that local ups manufacturer or local shops who prepare the transformers or individual parts understands what it really means by term 700W. But in case of imported UPS, we surely do know. LIMITS IMPOSED ON UPS BY MANUFACTURER The word 700W says that (P=VI, 700=220*I, I=3.181 Amperes) at any moment, if you will exceed the load by 3.181 ac amperes, the UPS will not handle it and has a safety switch which will go off or UPS will shut down without giving you a warning. Purpose of this limit is that beyond 3.181amperes of current, you ups equipment can get damaged so safety switch will go off, but there are limits on batteries as well and we want the ups to shut down if that is also being abused as otherwise we may experience voltage drop on output lines which will damage the attached electrical systems. MAXIMUM LIMITS OF YOUR BATTERIES Lead Acid batteries its self-have defined specs which clearly quotes amount of maximum current it can handle. Formula says that lead acid batteries should not be discharged at rate AMP-HR rating/6, or AMP-HR rating/4 or in extreme AMP-HR rating/3, below that you will definitely experience abnormal behavior such as dimming of lights, burnt tv?s, adopters, wifi devices. EXAMPLE: Maximum discharging rate: 200/6 turns out to be 66.666 dc amperes. Formula roughly says that you should not go near this limit but if you do, it may handle this for a while, exceeding this will immediately let you have it. Pin=Pout, 12*66.6666=220 *I ac, I ac=3.63 Now, after reading above two readings, you can clearly make out that this UPS will go well with 200 amp-hr batteries and will protect you against an undesirable voltage drop. PURPOSE OF LIMITS: dimming of lights is an undesirable thing on ups especially if you have attached power adopters, TV?s on it. If family member accidently connects an Iron on UPS line, then you would want the entire system to shutdown rather than experiencing a voltage drop as that can burn any delicate electrical instrument attached to your line. RULE OF THUMB: MAXIMUM LOAD LIMIT OF BATTERIES> Load LIMIT IMPOSED on UPS LOCAL UPS: local UPS has a variable on UPS card, through which you can easily make this adjustment. UPS shops has a circuit board on which they have different bulbs of different ratings, by turning on different bulbs of different ratings, they can make this adjustment on ups cards provided if you ask them to do so forcefully. PERSONALLY: if I had to buy a local ups, I would buy a 3000watt ups or maybe 2000watt, considering my 160AMP-HR bank, I would calculate things like this, amp-hr/4, 160/4=40, Pin=Pout, 12*40=220*I ac, I ac=2.181, I would have my ups trip by manually tuning if Ac load exceeds 2.181 amperes. TOTAL DISSOLVED SOLIDS (TDS) IN WATER AND ITS IMPLICATIONS ON BATTERY Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) are the total amount of mobile charged ions. Including minerals, salts, or metals dissolved in given volume of water expressed in units of mg per unit volume of water or also referred as parts per million (ppm) In short, batter water is a normal water from which dissolved salts and minerals have been removed either by a process known as distillation or de-ionization. Ideally battery water should have a TDS value varying from 0-10 ppm Ideal drinking water should have TDS value between 0-500.  RED BATTERY WATER SOLD IN MARKET IS A FRAUD. Recently after having bought the TDS meter from aliexpress.com, I got the chance to test things after having bought 100 liters of de-ionized water from a reliable supplier based in plot#277, street 1, I-9/3 and a regular bottle of battery water being sold in open market for Rs. 30 per 200ml for sake of testing. To my surprised, the RED battery water sold in market had a TDS value of 615 whereas home tab water had a TDS value of 339 and de-ionized water bought from source mentioned on main thread had the TDS value of 3. In-order to verify things, I further went to 6 different shops and bought the red colored battery water from different sources and non-had a TDS value below 500. You can very well understand that you being ripped in market, made to buy water which is not even near fit for its intended use. TDS VALUES OF DE-IONIZED WATER (BATTERY WATER) AVAILABLE IN MARKET FROM DIFFERENT MANUFACTURER: Volta battery water?s TDS value turned out to be 466 ppm posted on message no 2259, page 113 on this thread with pictures and compared with Nestle water with TDS value of 176. 2. Guard battery water?s TDS value turned out to be 345 ppm posted on message no 2272, page 114 on this thread with pictures and compared with my Home Tab water with TDS value of 195. Aone Spark battery water TDS value turned out to be 741 ppm posted on message no 2304, page 116 on this thread with pictures and compared with my Home Tab water with TDS value of 217 this time as expected as this is a running water. So clearly Aone Spark battery water is also not fit for batteries. AGS Battery Tonic TDS value turned out to be 005 ppm posted on message no 2327, page 117 on this thread with pictures by @ Me4726. I am glad to see, least AGS is not cheating on her buyers. Later, I also got a chance to perform test on AGS tonic bought from another shop and TDS value turned out to be 004 ppm, consistent with earlier reading taken by a member. Valley Ultra Distilled water, contact no: 051-4430067, 051-4101005, email address: nfsvalley@hotmail.com TDS results turned out to be 004 ppm posted on message no: 2322, page 117 with results posted by @asjdsm. I also have taken the TDS reading and picture can also be seen in last image of main body of thread in a cup with a TDS meter inserted. Battery water being sold under the name of “BATTERY TONIC with AGS battery’s picture on it” has TDS value turned out to be 339 ppm posted on message no 2875, page 144 on this thread with picture. TDS value of De-ionized water from Pryo Chemicals turned out to be 32ppm, test was done on a single sample of De-ionized water bottle bought from a PSO pump in DHA Lahore. I will keep on adding the results here, few brothers have ordered the TDS meter online and they would be able to re-verify the readings later. Anyway, above is a disturbing trend, since most of us don?t have a choice so I would advise you to prefer Nestle Drinking water over this crap being sold in market to top up the batteries for time being till we are not able to locate a good supplier.","Ive been posting time and again that you need to use distilled water to make the battery acid. tap water has chlorine and other salt minerals which upset the mixture and ruins the battery. I procure distilled water in 5 litre jugs and have a lab supply place that sells me acid not in drums but in 5 litre brown glass bottles - this acid is lab grade, (dont know what the drum is) when I make the acid and pour it into local Pakistani Exide, AGS or FB batteries - They can even start big old diesels in super cold weather - and keep a standing charge of 12.7 or 12.8 volts for about a week before dropping below 12.6V, they give great cranking amps for heavy starting loads. The battery carbon pile tester proves it. I usually put one bottle of distilled in the freezer to add during mixing to cool down the mixture fast - and I prepare the mixture to 1.270 SG at room temperature, and confirm this by weighing 1 litre of it on a digital scale. I also prefer to use a giant glass tub I have - as the plastic resin drum can etch itself from acid I buy local batteries dry as the place knows me - and know that I do a far better job than them (they sometimes ask me to prepare some battery acid for their special customers) - and never have had to claim warranty from them. You should also periodically check your charging voltage on your UPS and see if the mixture is gassing from time to time. I also like to put UPS batteries on spring perches so I can shake them now and then, it evens out the acid mixture when its not gassing - prevents sulphation of the plates",,
"PERSONAL EXPERIENCE Three years back I got interested in analyzing the procedure which is used by battery maintenance shops. They purchase Sulfuric in drums and then mix it with tap water in 66 % by volume. They say that chemical reaction causes the water to boil which remove the oxygen molecules from the mixture hence results in giving up gravity of 1250 which they pour it in car batteries. Batteries run fine for year or two whereas I think if it is all about removing impurities from car batteries then they are making a mistake by adding tap water which would off course boil the water but would not guarantee the removal of impurities present inside the water. I have six batteries of 200 Amps each in my office which can support 15 computers during heavy load shedding. In order to overcome the Myth, I purchased a drum of Sulfuric Acid and have mixed it with distilled water which I have produced it in my own lab. I took all my batteries outside and have flushed it with tab water to remove all the deposits present inside the batteries. Flush was performed multiple times then batteries were refilled with Acid of 1250-1270 gravity prepared within my office compound. Since, electrolyte was prepared with distilled water and UPS was properly adjusted so even at the end of the third year my batteries are able to provide 90 % backup time as compared to the time of purchase, even after excessive load shedding of 1 hour?s; 5-6 times a day from last three years. Flush is a periodic exercise which is performed at least once a year also I have adjusted the output of my UPS to charge per battery at rate not more than 8 Amps. So basically the right ups settings along with a good electrolyte and distilled water prepared in my own lab used for topping up the batteries later made the difference. That?s is not something difficult as my entire intent is to educate my audience regarding these simple techniques which will give you years of trouble free service. NOTE: ELECTROLYTE GRAVITY IS ADJUSTED ONCE IN START, LATER YOU POUR DE-IONIZED OR DISTILLED WATER FOR TOPPING UP. CHANGE IN S.G LATER IN ANY CELL POINTS TOWARDS A PROBLEM AREA. AT THIS STAGE, YOU NEED TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE EITHER BY LOOKING AT UPS ADJUSTMENT, EITHER IT?S BECAUSE OF BAD ELECTROLYTE OR NEEDS A FLUSH. LESSONS LEARN: 1) If electrolyte is prepared with tab water then batteries will die much earlier than its actual life. 2) Wrong UPS settings is yet another major factor which contributes in killing your batteries much earlier. 3) With wrong combinations of both, you will start to experience problems with batteries within first three months. Having understood the issue, My two 220 AMP-HR batteries connected with my UPS at home powers the entire house lighting, fans and runs flawlessly without much reducing the electrolyte and backup time even after two years. HOW TO ADJUST UPS Most of us are using the similar local UPS sold in market. The only problem with these UPS is that they have few parameters which most of the times are not adjusted properly. Now once you buy these UPS then try to get it adjusted at shop before bringing it to your home. By rule of thumb the maximum allowable charging rate of Lead Acid batteries are its Amp Hour rating divided by 10. For 145 AH battery; the correct charging rate is 145 AH/10 is 14.5 Volts. Anything above this would be termed as fast charging which would damage your batteries in long run. Slow charging is good for batteries but if intensity of load shedding is frequent then probably batteries won?t be prepared before it enters next cycle of load shedding. So you need to look into your circumstances before adjusting this figure but in circumstances you should go above maximum allowable charging rate. You should always ask local UPS shops to adjust these parameters according to specification given below. If you are interested in learning them then ask him to do it in front of you. Mark those parameters with paper tape so that you don?t forget once you do it yourself. Also try to work these settings in your mind first so that you may directly dictate the electrician. These UPS have a PCB card which has many variables. These variables can be adjusted using a screw driver. During load shedding the Output of the UPS is much more than normal Voltage. Adjust the variables such that your Output Voltage should never exceed 265 Volts once batteries are fully charged and put into backup mode. Adjust such that once output voltage reaches 220 Volts then your UPS should trigger the alarm and should shutdown within 10 seconds. Adjust the charging rate of each battery such that (AMP HOUR rating divided by 10). E.g For 200 AMP-HR batteries, I can keep it somewhere closer to 15 Amperes but will never exceed 20 amperes. Slow charging is very good for batteries but look into your circumstances as batteries will take more time to charge its self and you need to the batteries to be prepared for next cycle of load shedding. UPS should stop charging your batteries once the output voltage two batteries connected in series reaches 28 Volts and for single battery UPS system, it reaches 14 Volts. This is termed as cutoff Voltage. During Load shedding, once output of batteries (where two batteries are connected in Series) reaches 21 Volts then Alarm should trigger and UPS must be shut down immediately. Also note the output of UPS at that instance as it should not be less than 220 Volts otherwise sensitive electronic equipments such as TV?s, computers and routers will start to restart its self. Always keep your UPS line separate from main line. Your UPS should shutdown immediately if load exceeds the maximum capacity. UPS shops have different bulbs installed on board with different Powers to adjust these settings on UPS system. Always test under full load so that you are aware about the maximum load your UPS can take. Now, your computers should be safe under these configurations. You will need a good quality Voltmeter and AMP meter. Since chemical properties of battery?s changes the entire year so you will have to check your tuning after every few months which you can easily do with help of a Voltmeter, Amp-meter & hydrometer. PREPARING ELECTROLYTE: I don?t recommend that you prepare the electrolyte at home as mixing sulfuric acid with distilled water produces a lot of heat which can severely hurt any individual. If you can buy the electrolyte of 1250 gravity from some company like PRYO chemicals then that?s a best possible scenario. Otherwise, follow below. HOW TO PRODUCE DISTILLED WATER It is very easy to produce distilled water at home. By distilled water we simply refer to the water which is heated then it changes its form into steam. Steam should be allowed to pass through some system where it can condense so that it may change its form back into liquid and this liquid can be collected in some separate container. This liquid will be free from all sorts of impurities and is called distilled water. I have used a pressure cooker, air conditioning coils, rubber pipes, two plastic containers one for dipping the coils into cold water so that steam inside the coil can change its form back into liquid and other end connected to rubber pipe so that now distilled water can be collected into a second plastic container. HOW TO MIX ACID WITH DISTILLED WATER Specific gravity is measured in (kg/cu.m) for your reference as I won?t be repeating these symbols during this topic afterwards. Water has a specific gravity of 1000 where as Sulphuric acid has specific gravity of 1800. Once you mix 66% (in volume) of distilled water in 34% (in volume) Sulphuric Acid then you should get a gravity of 1240. But normally you end up getting a gravity of 1400 as lot of distilled water is evaporated during this process due to heat being generated. You can make later adjustments using distilled water once Acid has cooled down as at that time no heat will be generated. Always remember that battery will show increased gravity once charged and reduced gravity once discharged. Initially aim for gravity of 1250 and then you can take the reading after a week and make fine adjustments by using electrolyte prepared earlier of 1400 gravity or 1350. Always pour Acid on distilled Water not distilled water on Acid. Wear Rough Clothes, Glasses and gloves if possible. Keep the Acid and Mixture out from the reach of Children. Lot of heat would be generated during this process so be very careful. Always Use plastic Container not Metal. Mixture will take minimum 24 hours to cool down. Never pour the mixture inside the battery once it?s hot. 64 % distilled water should be Mixed with 36 % Acid by Volume. You may end up getting a gravity of 1400. Keep hydrometer with you and only check once fluid has cooled down. You can perform later adjustments by pouring more distilled water on the mixture once it has cooled down and at that time no heat will be generated. Use Plastic bottles to store the mixture. Always Label it as ?Very Dangerous Sulphuric Acid with Gravity ABC ?. Keep it in safe place where no one other then you can touch it. Container used for producing the mixture should never again be used for taking bath. Don?t allow anyone to misuse the Acid for hurting anyone. HOW TO PERFORM FLUSH Procedure which I follow is that I fully charge my batteries, then take the batteries outside, drained the electrolyte in proper sewerage line while I already have an access to new electrolyte which was prepared earlier before performing this procedure and have the batteries flushed it with tap water 5-6 times. Later put the battery in upside down position for 30 minutes before pouring new electrolyte back in. DIAGNOSING ISSUES WITH UPS SYSTEM (BATTERIES AND UPS) KNOW YOUR SITUATION: Electricity outrage in Pakistan varies, sometimes after every 6 hours in few places and sometime after every hour for next three hours. UPS might be perfectly tuned but may fail to cope up with changing situation. Charging rate which may be properly set up for winter season or for few areas may not be able to cope up with high demand once electricity outrage will be more frequent. Under these scenario, first your ups may not be able to give desired performance and secondly your batteries may be exposed to damage which may result from remaining discharge for an extended period. It is very important that two variables must be properly adjusted on UPS, the first one is low cut off voltages and second one is the charging rate which may require adjustments as per the situation as highlighted above. LOW CUT OFF VOLTAGE: This variable is set to 10.3Volts and UPS should trip once voltage on battery terminals reaches this voltage. As extended discharging will surely damage the batteries very soon once voltage on battery terminal will drop below 10.3Volts. CHARGING RATE: this much be adjusted in accordance to your situation, you should know the maximum allowable charging rate, slow charging is good for batteries but once electric outrage is more frequent and for long duration then you should try to increase the charging rate till ups is able to charge the batteries within hour or two. For example, If you have two batteries of pheonix UGS 215, whereas the company?s wesite site says that its AMP-HR rating is 160AMP-HR and charging rate is set to 7Amperes then use the formula of maximum allowable charging rate AMP-HR/10 which in this case comes out to be: 160/10=16, try to increase the charging rate till 10 Amperes or 14 Amp but never exceed 16 Amperes. Then try to observe if next time UPS charges the battery in needed time or not and correspondingly you can make the fine adjustments. Charging rate is set by attaching the AMP meter on battery wire, then slightly turning the charging rate variable on PCB board while ups is still charging the batteries. Either it?s going to increase or decrease which you can easily see on amp meter. TWO MOST IMPORTANT VARIABLES: CHARGING RATE AND CUT OFF VOLTAGE People who says that their batteries dies within 3 to 6 months or they start to experience low backup time very soon then they should cross verify the cut off voltage at which charging stops and the charging rate. If your these two variables are set properly then your battery will not give you unexpected surprises and plus it has a good electrolyte then trust me, it will easily go above 2.5 years provided battery does not have any manufacturing fault. THINGS WHICH ONE SHOULD CONSIDER BEFORE BUYING A UPS SYSTEM AND SELECTING BATTERIES FOR IT. Imported ups will definitely will save you from many problems, as you won?t have to worry about cut off voltage at which charging stops, low cut off voltage at which ups should trip, load setting which indicates the maximum load which ups can take, output voltages if you want to run your TV or computers on ups but still people do make a mistake even once buying the imported UPS system. Which is that they don?t consider reading the maximum charging rate at which ups starts to charge the batteries and they correspondingly don?t select the correct battery. Most of the imported ups system starts to charge the batteries at 10-12 Volts which implies that you should never buy a battery whose AMP-HR rating is below 150 least. Charging rate on imported UPS are fixed and can?t be manually adjusted. Good thing is that it charges the battery at three different charging rates which corresponds to the voltages on battery terminals which is a desirable thing. IF YOU WANT TO RUN YOUR TV?S AND COMPUTERS ON UPS SYSTEMS: IMPORTED UPS Even if batteries are not in good health, imported ups will maintain the output voltage to 220 and would trip once batteries will discharge to a limit as set by factory. So we have no problem here. LOCAL UPS: But with local UPS systems, output voltage will drop once batteries are going to discharge. You should not set the output voltage of local ups to 220 volts once batteries are fully charged as by time once batteries will be completely discharge with voltage on battery terminal to be around 10.3 Volts then maybe your output voltage will drop to 160 to 180 Volts. That?s why it is important that output voltage maybe set to 250 or 255 volts so by the time once voltage on battery terminals should reach 10.3 Volts then output voltage may still be above 220 Volts. Otherwise, you will keep on experiencing burnt WIFI adopters, mobile charging adopters, wifi devices and TV?S. Output voltage on ups is adjusted by fully charging the batteries and removing every device off from its output just in-order to be safe. Then you need to insert the voltmeter in its output and adjust the output voltage to a desired value using the onboard variable. SOLAR INVERTERS, ON-GRID, OFF-GRID, BATTERIES COMPATIBILITY WITH INVERTER AND SOLAR PANELS   Not all solar inverters are compatible with solar panels or for matter of fact goes well with any sort of batteries may it be dry or lead acid batteries. Things will work, but will eventually ruin your battery bank very quickly for reasons discussed in thread below. It is very important that one carefully selects the inverter which is able to provide the correct voltage needed to charge the batteries. Things such as inverter allows you to wire few solar panels in series, your load, inverter type, how different systems are integrated with each other at battery level, what should be your total panels output needed to charge the batteries and simultaneously power the attached load such that it does not kills your battery bank or leave it uncharged is discussed and how could your replace your ups with hybrid solar inverter which means saving in terms of electricity bills due to UPS. I be happy to extend my experience and knowledge on subject matter either on thread below or on same thread. 13https://www.pakwheels.com/forums/mechanical-electrical/276598-diy-solar-panel-installation-controller-selection-batteries13 DISTILLED AND DE-IONIZED WATER SUPPLIERS I will start adding the locations and address of agencies which provide distilled and de-ionized water here. Right now one of the members (@stonedsaint) have provided this address and I have verified this by calling them as they are offering de-ionized water at Rs 9/Liter. You should take your bottle along with you otherwise they charge Rs 500 non-refundable for big plastic container.

Comments: Rs 9/Liter seems like a good deal. Pyrochem provides Electrolyte prepared with De-ionized water, those who are based in Lahore can contact them. Delivery Guy, according to one member @deltoid61 says that they may be able to provide in other cities. Pyrochem (Pvt) Limited, 96-Bank Square Market, Model Town, Lahore - Pakistan. Tel: +92-42-35839278 / 35854646, Fax: +92-42-35887366 E-mail: info@pyrochem.com.pk Here is number of delivery Guy 0300-4729119 ASK FOR 4% TO 5% DISCOUNT ON ORIGINAL BATTERY PRICE IF YOU INTEND TO PREPARE YOUR OWN ELECTROLYTE OR BUY IT FROM ANOTHER SOURCE Once you have confirmed the final price on a given battery then ask them for a discount if you intend to prepare the electrolyte yourself or buy It from somewhere else. most battery shops provide the discount happily if you want to use your own electrolyte. I do it all the time once I buy a new battery and @deltoid61 has reported the same on post no: 1298 WRONG FLUSH PROCEDURE AND PRACTICES I really find it hard to replay every one as people are making all sorts of mistake while making the flush and most of them are doing it blindly not knowing if it?s going to be successful or not. kindly judge before doing so and won?t be successful under the condition. You had been using dirty electrolyte right from start and batteries have gone bad or impurities are coated on the cells leaving very little active material behind. Batteries have died because of slow charging rate such that it enters into next cycle of load shedding without being properly charged or cutoff Voltage is badly set such as 27 Volts for double battery system. Or batteries are damaged because of overcharging such that one of the cells are now damaged. Or batteries have outlived its useful life and very less active material is left on the cells. You may perform flush You can still perform flush if you know batteries had the bad electrolyte and still all cells are ok and now you want to replace it with good one. Once charging rate, cutoff voltage is properly setup and you feel in-between that now backup time has started to drop and then do it immediately. MAIN REASON, LIGHT FLUSH IS PERFORMED. As the battery sheds its lead to the bottom of the container, a conductive layer forms, and once the contaminated material fills the allotted space at bottom of the battery and conductive material reaches the plates then creates a shorting effect and sometimes conductive material gets stuck between two plates creating a short and drains the battery fast. This condition only happens on a batteries which properly charges and discharges unlike batteries which never gets a chance to charge properly or die prematurely because of formation of sulfate crystals. Perform flush, once your charging system is properly adjusted right from start and you have noticed that backup time is dropping then immediately perform flush so that you can eliminate above factor by doing so. I have been successful number of times in restoring the backup time as I understand what I am doing. Even then you go ahead and perform flush without being successful then note that above factor was not responsible for reduced backup time. Do it before a damage has occurred as nothing you will do later will bring a bad cell back to its life. SPECIFIC GRAVITY AND PEOPLES CONFUSION Electrolyte specific gravity is an indicator which tells that batteries are good or bad. To make it simple, just like we use voltmeter to measure dc voltage on battery terminals and AC output voltage, we use amp-meter to measure the charging rate on batteries as these values helps us tune our UPS, the same way Electrolyte specific gravity measured with help of hydrometer tells us lot about how good your batteries are. It?s little tricky to draw conclusions out after reading the specific gravity so don?t start getting worried very quickly. So understand it this way, that you cannot answer few question by a single answer, same is the case with S.G reading. You need to consider following before drawing any conclusion. Specific gravity reading should always be taken on a fully charged batteries, as during discharging, sulfuric acid within electrolyte gets absorbed in cells whereas during charging sulfuric acid comes out to mix with the electrolyte within batteries so you will never observe a good value if you will take those readings on a fully discharged batteries, may your batteries have no issues and you may keep on getting worried for nothing. Once, new electrolyte is added in batteries (on new batteries or after flush) with ups properly tuned, then it takes approximately two weeks for batteries to show its true S.G value. This is because, the sulfuric acid content within the electrolyte is heavy and goes down to settle in bottom. Within repeated charging and discharging, it gives ample chance for both the contents in electrolyte which is sulfuric acid and distilled water to mix with each other. If you know, your UPS is properly turned then don?t get immediately worried after adding the electrolyte in batteries. Variation of SPECIFIC GRAVITY between different cells straightaway points towards a problem with one or with more cells. You can jump to the conclusion directly here. Kindly take into account, if I misquoted somewhere that if you need to increase the specific gravity then add electrolyte with higher specific gravity into it. Normally if electrolyte was prepared with right adjustments in start then you don?t need to do this throughout the life span of battery so always add distilled water if level of electrolyte drops later at any stage. Later if you see that all the cells are showing 1250 or 1230 specific gravity except one which is showing 1160 then that?s an indicator that this cell is bad. Adding electrolyte with higher specific gravity will not solve the problem. It?s up-to you, if you want to perform the flush or any other exercise which may recover the cell before it completely goes bad. ISSUE WITH BATTERY REPAIR SHOPS: INSTALLING NEW LEAD PLATES Analyze the issue, every battery designed or manufactured is on certain AMP-HR ratings that is dictated by cells cross section area, thickness and lead plates in every cell. Now if you have a 200 AMP-HR battery which you have given to the repair shop, then how do you expect that to attach the same numbers of plates in every cell that they will use the same cross section area and thickness depending upon the AMP-HR ratings? These repair people are mostly uneducated and they have standard plates which they fit in every battery thus this alters the original AMP-HR ratings. Once a battery which used to be off 200 AMP-HR rating was charged at 15 Amperes of current by UPS has now became maybe of 70 AMP-HR rating and has become unfit to be charged at the same rate. God knows, where they buy the lead plates from and what about its quality s and above all, I once got the job done from them on two of my 200 Amp-hr batteries and lead plates which they fit in were of a very small size as compared to what it came from factory originally. And they charged me RS 4000 for single battery, not worth the time and money to be wasted on it and above all it died within first two months with much reduce backup time. DEEP CYCLE BATTERIES VS ORDINARY STARTER LEAD ACID BATTERIES: Difference between deep cycle batteries and ordinary lead acid batteries are the plate specification, deep cycle batteries have been designed for UPS/INVERTERS, solar panels and to be used with wind turbines, have think plates and can considerably discharge to a lower limit such as 50% of the batteries capacity where as ordinary lead acid batteries can only be discharged to 80% then they would require charging again, have thin plates with large surface area and very good for cranking vehicles as it can deliver high voltage for a very short duration of time as needed for the application. So there is a tradeoff between cold cranking voltages and backup time. Recently I have seen phoenix batteries in Pakistan producing UGS series specifically designed for UPS/INVERTERS. Although, the site does not clearly labels its as deep cycle batteries but still should be preferred over ordinarily lead acid batteries because of thicker plate size as desired and will surely last for a longer time. I am sure, they will not try to rip people by increasing their price just for heck free publicity they are getting from here. DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 12 VOLT UPS AND 24 VOLT UPS: Many find this confusing, so you can understand this way that lead acid battery manufacturers develop batteries in 12Volt format, so now UPS manufacturer?s designs a system in-order to get connected to 12 Volt battery or two 12 Volts batteries connected in series to make it a 24 Volts system just in-order to double the backup time for those who desire such system. Connecting batteries in series doubles the voltage but AMP-HR rating for the system would remain same. Which just says that formula which is applicable for calculating the maximum allowable charging rate for 12 Volt battery bank will also apply to a 24 Volt battery bank. Let me explain this with example, if you have 160 AMP-HR battery connected with 12Volts system then maximum allowable charging rate for this case is 160/10=16, now if you have two 160AMP-HR batteries connected in series on 24Volt system then again maximum allowable charging rate will again be 16 amperes for this setup, it?s just that now you can run the same load for double the time on 24Volts setup. If novices does not wants to confuse himself, then don?t read further. You must be thinking that I can connect two batteries of same capacity on 12 Volts UPS system in parallel configuration which will also double the backup time. Then answer is that you are right, but here you will have to add up the AMP-HR capacities of both the batteries in-order to calculate the new maximum allowable charging rate and discharging rate. In parallel configuration with two 160 AMP-HR batteries, you can now charge your system at 32 amperes of maximum allowable charging rate as current divides in parallel configuration. So in short, if your 12 volts one battery could have lit maximum 15 of the energy savers for one hours than 24 battery bank can light the same for 2 hours. Now, once you will add two batteries in parallel on 12 Volts system then you can increase the number of bulbs to 30, can either lit those 30 for one hour or turn 15 off to light yet another 15 for two hours. Hope, you must have got it as I could not make it simpler this this. P.S: in above example, I have ignored the limitations imposed by UPS on a battery bank, like few have safety switches, which will go off if you will try to light 30 energy savers for 1 hour on 12 Volts system with two batteries in parallel. WHAT DOES 700W, 1000W AND 3000W UPS MEAN: I don?t think, that local ups manufacturer or local shops who prepare the transformers or individual parts understands what it really means by term 700W. But in case of imported UPS, we surely do know. LIMITS IMPOSED ON UPS BY MANUFACTURER The word 700W says that (P=VI, 700=220*I, I=3.181 Amperes) at any moment, if you will exceed the load by 3.181 ac amperes, the UPS will not handle it and has a safety switch which will go off or UPS will shut down without giving you a warning. Purpose of this limit is that beyond 3.181amperes of current, you ups equipment can get damaged so safety switch will go off, but there are limits on batteries as well and we want the ups to shut down if that is also being abused as otherwise we may experience voltage drop on output lines which will damage the attached electrical systems. MAXIMUM LIMITS OF YOUR BATTERIES Lead Acid batteries its self-have defined specs which clearly quotes amount of maximum current it can handle. Formula says that lead acid batteries should not be discharged at rate AMP-HR rating/6, or AMP-HR rating/4 or in extreme AMP-HR rating/3, below that you will definitely experience abnormal behavior such as dimming of lights, burnt tv?s, adopters, wifi devices. EXAMPLE: Maximum discharging rate: 200/6 turns out to be 66.666 dc amperes. Formula roughly says that you should not go near this limit but if you do, it may handle this for a while, exceeding this will immediately let you have it. Pin=Pout, 12*66.6666=220 *I ac, I ac=3.63 Now, after reading above two readings, you can clearly make out that this UPS will go well with 200 amp-hr batteries and will protect you against an undesirable voltage drop. PURPOSE OF LIMITS: dimming of lights is an undesirable thing on ups especially if you have attached power adopters, TV?s on it. If family member accidently connects an Iron on UPS line, then you would want the entire system to shutdown rather than experiencing a voltage drop as that can burn any delicate electrical instrument attached to your line. RULE OF THUMB: MAXIMUM LOAD LIMIT OF BATTERIES> Load LIMIT IMPOSED on UPS LOCAL UPS: local UPS has a variable on UPS card, through which you can easily make this adjustment. UPS shops has a circuit board on which they have different bulbs of different ratings, by turning on different bulbs of different ratings, they can make this adjustment on ups cards provided if you ask them to do so forcefully. PERSONALLY: if I had to buy a local ups, I would buy a 3000watt ups or maybe 2000watt, considering my 160AMP-HR bank, I would calculate things like this, amp-hr/4, 160/4=40, Pin=Pout, 12*40=220*I ac, I ac=2.181, I would have my ups trip by manually tuning if Ac load exceeds 2.181 amperes. TOTAL DISSOLVED SOLIDS (TDS) IN WATER AND ITS IMPLICATIONS ON BATTERY Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) are the total amount of mobile charged ions. Including minerals, salts, or metals dissolved in given volume of water expressed in units of mg per unit volume of water or also referred as parts per million (ppm) In short, batter water is a normal water from which dissolved salts and minerals have been removed either by a process known as distillation or de-ionization. Ideally battery water should have a TDS value varying from 0-10 ppm Ideal drinking water should have TDS value between 0-500.  RED BATTERY WATER SOLD IN MARKET IS A FRAUD. Recently after having bought the TDS meter from aliexpress.com, I got the chance to test things after having bought 100 liters of de-ionized water from a reliable supplier based in plot#277, street 1, I-9/3 and a regular bottle of battery water being sold in open market for Rs. 30 per 200ml for sake of testing. To my surprised, the RED battery water sold in market had a TDS value of 615 whereas home tab water had a TDS value of 339 and de-ionized water bought from source mentioned on main thread had the TDS value of 3. In-order to verify things, I further went to 6 different shops and bought the red colored battery water from different sources and non-had a TDS value below 500. You can very well understand that you being ripped in market, made to buy water which is not even near fit for its intended use. TDS VALUES OF DE-IONIZED WATER (BATTERY WATER) AVAILABLE IN MARKET FROM DIFFERENT MANUFACTURER: Volta battery water?s TDS value turned out to be 466 ppm posted on message no 2259, page 113 on this thread with pictures and compared with Nestle water with TDS value of 176. 2. Guard battery water?s TDS value turned out to be 345 ppm posted on message no 2272, page 114 on this thread with pictures and compared with my Home Tab water with TDS value of 195. Aone Spark battery water TDS value turned out to be 741 ppm posted on message no 2304, page 116 on this thread with pictures and compared with my Home Tab water with TDS value of 217 this time as expected as this is a running water. So clearly Aone Spark battery water is also not fit for batteries. AGS Battery Tonic TDS value turned out to be 005 ppm posted on message no 2327, page 117 on this thread with pictures by @ Me4726. I am glad to see, least AGS is not cheating on her buyers. Later, I also got a chance to perform test on AGS tonic bought from another shop and TDS value turned out to be 004 ppm, consistent with earlier reading taken by a member. Valley Ultra Distilled water, contact no: 051-4430067, 051-4101005, email address: nfsvalley@hotmail.com TDS results turned out to be 004 ppm posted on message no: 2322, page 117 with results posted by @asjdsm. I also have taken the TDS reading and picture can also be seen in last image of main body of thread in a cup with a TDS meter inserted. Battery water being sold under the name of “BATTERY TONIC with AGS battery’s picture on it” has TDS value turned out to be 339 ppm posted on message no 2875, page 144 on this thread with picture. TDS value of De-ionized water from Pryo Chemicals turned out to be 32ppm, test was done on a single sample of De-ionized water bottle bought from a PSO pump in DHA Lahore. I will keep on adding the results here, few brothers have ordered the TDS meter online and they would be able to re-verify the readings later. Anyway, above is a disturbing trend, since most of us don?t have a choice so I would advise you to prefer Nestle Drinking water over this crap being sold in market to top up the batteries for time being till we are not able to locate a good supplier.","talhawaleed;2529566: I bought 20 Liters drum of Sulphuric Acid for 400 Rs which should be enough to produce enough mixture for 5 washroom Baltis of Acid. 1 balti would be consumed for one 200 AMPS battery. 1) Always pour Acid on distilled Water not distilled water on Acid 2) Wear Rough Clothes, Glasses and gloves if possible. 3) Keep the Acid and Mixture out from the reach of Children 4) Lot of heat would be generated during this process & be very careful. 5) Always Use plastic balti not Metallic 6) Mixture will take 24 hours to cool down 7) Never pour the mixture inside the battery once it is Hot 8) 64 % distilled water should be Mixed with 36 % Acid 9) You may end up getting a gravity of 1400 10) Keep hydrometer with you and only check once fluid has cooled down 11) You can perform later adjustments by pouring more distilled water on the mixture once it has cooled down and at that time no heat will be generated. 12) Use 2 Liters pepsi plastic bottles to store the mixture 13) Label it “ Very Dangerous Sulphuric Acid with Gravity bala bala “ 14) Keep it in safe place where no one other then you can touch it 15) Balti used for producing the mixture should never again be used for taking bath. 1) Entire exercise will have no meaning if you are not using distilled water. Do it at your own risk and don’t allow anyone to miss use the Acid for hurting anyone otherwise you can go to jail. hmm Rs 400 for 20 litres conc acid - thats cheap, the 5 litre bottle I buy is Rs 250/-",,
"PERSONAL EXPERIENCE Three years back I got interested in analyzing the procedure which is used by battery maintenance shops. They purchase Sulfuric in drums and then mix it with tap water in 66 % by volume. They say that chemical reaction causes the water to boil which remove the oxygen molecules from the mixture hence results in giving up gravity of 1250 which they pour it in car batteries. Batteries run fine for year or two whereas I think if it is all about removing impurities from car batteries then they are making a mistake by adding tap water which would off course boil the water but would not guarantee the removal of impurities present inside the water. I have six batteries of 200 Amps each in my office which can support 15 computers during heavy load shedding. In order to overcome the Myth, I purchased a drum of Sulfuric Acid and have mixed it with distilled water which I have produced it in my own lab. I took all my batteries outside and have flushed it with tab water to remove all the deposits present inside the batteries. Flush was performed multiple times then batteries were refilled with Acid of 1250-1270 gravity prepared within my office compound. Since, electrolyte was prepared with distilled water and UPS was properly adjusted so even at the end of the third year my batteries are able to provide 90 % backup time as compared to the time of purchase, even after excessive load shedding of 1 hour?s; 5-6 times a day from last three years. Flush is a periodic exercise which is performed at least once a year also I have adjusted the output of my UPS to charge per battery at rate not more than 8 Amps. So basically the right ups settings along with a good electrolyte and distilled water prepared in my own lab used for topping up the batteries later made the difference. That?s is not something difficult as my entire intent is to educate my audience regarding these simple techniques which will give you years of trouble free service. NOTE: ELECTROLYTE GRAVITY IS ADJUSTED ONCE IN START, LATER YOU POUR DE-IONIZED OR DISTILLED WATER FOR TOPPING UP. CHANGE IN S.G LATER IN ANY CELL POINTS TOWARDS A PROBLEM AREA. AT THIS STAGE, YOU NEED TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE EITHER BY LOOKING AT UPS ADJUSTMENT, EITHER IT?S BECAUSE OF BAD ELECTROLYTE OR NEEDS A FLUSH. LESSONS LEARN: 1) If electrolyte is prepared with tab water then batteries will die much earlier than its actual life. 2) Wrong UPS settings is yet another major factor which contributes in killing your batteries much earlier. 3) With wrong combinations of both, you will start to experience problems with batteries within first three months. Having understood the issue, My two 220 AMP-HR batteries connected with my UPS at home powers the entire house lighting, fans and runs flawlessly without much reducing the electrolyte and backup time even after two years. HOW TO ADJUST UPS Most of us are using the similar local UPS sold in market. The only problem with these UPS is that they have few parameters which most of the times are not adjusted properly. Now once you buy these UPS then try to get it adjusted at shop before bringing it to your home. By rule of thumb the maximum allowable charging rate of Lead Acid batteries are its Amp Hour rating divided by 10. For 145 AH battery; the correct charging rate is 145 AH/10 is 14.5 Volts. Anything above this would be termed as fast charging which would damage your batteries in long run. Slow charging is good for batteries but if intensity of load shedding is frequent then probably batteries won?t be prepared before it enters next cycle of load shedding. So you need to look into your circumstances before adjusting this figure but in circumstances you should go above maximum allowable charging rate. You should always ask local UPS shops to adjust these parameters according to specification given below. If you are interested in learning them then ask him to do it in front of you. Mark those parameters with paper tape so that you don?t forget once you do it yourself. Also try to work these settings in your mind first so that you may directly dictate the electrician. These UPS have a PCB card which has many variables. These variables can be adjusted using a screw driver. During load shedding the Output of the UPS is much more than normal Voltage. Adjust the variables such that your Output Voltage should never exceed 265 Volts once batteries are fully charged and put into backup mode. Adjust such that once output voltage reaches 220 Volts then your UPS should trigger the alarm and should shutdown within 10 seconds. Adjust the charging rate of each battery such that (AMP HOUR rating divided by 10). E.g For 200 AMP-HR batteries, I can keep it somewhere closer to 15 Amperes but will never exceed 20 amperes. Slow charging is very good for batteries but look into your circumstances as batteries will take more time to charge its self and you need to the batteries to be prepared for next cycle of load shedding. UPS should stop charging your batteries once the output voltage two batteries connected in series reaches 28 Volts and for single battery UPS system, it reaches 14 Volts. This is termed as cutoff Voltage. During Load shedding, once output of batteries (where two batteries are connected in Series) reaches 21 Volts then Alarm should trigger and UPS must be shut down immediately. Also note the output of UPS at that instance as it should not be less than 220 Volts otherwise sensitive electronic equipments such as TV?s, computers and routers will start to restart its self. Always keep your UPS line separate from main line. Your UPS should shutdown immediately if load exceeds the maximum capacity. UPS shops have different bulbs installed on board with different Powers to adjust these settings on UPS system. Always test under full load so that you are aware about the maximum load your UPS can take. Now, your computers should be safe under these configurations. You will need a good quality Voltmeter and AMP meter. Since chemical properties of battery?s changes the entire year so you will have to check your tuning after every few months which you can easily do with help of a Voltmeter, Amp-meter & hydrometer. PREPARING ELECTROLYTE: I don?t recommend that you prepare the electrolyte at home as mixing sulfuric acid with distilled water produces a lot of heat which can severely hurt any individual. If you can buy the electrolyte of 1250 gravity from some company like PRYO chemicals then that?s a best possible scenario. Otherwise, follow below. HOW TO PRODUCE DISTILLED WATER It is very easy to produce distilled water at home. By distilled water we simply refer to the water which is heated then it changes its form into steam. Steam should be allowed to pass through some system where it can condense so that it may change its form back into liquid and this liquid can be collected in some separate container. This liquid will be free from all sorts of impurities and is called distilled water. I have used a pressure cooker, air conditioning coils, rubber pipes, two plastic containers one for dipping the coils into cold water so that steam inside the coil can change its form back into liquid and other end connected to rubber pipe so that now distilled water can be collected into a second plastic container. HOW TO MIX ACID WITH DISTILLED WATER Specific gravity is measured in (kg/cu.m) for your reference as I won?t be repeating these symbols during this topic afterwards. Water has a specific gravity of 1000 where as Sulphuric acid has specific gravity of 1800. Once you mix 66% (in volume) of distilled water in 34% (in volume) Sulphuric Acid then you should get a gravity of 1240. But normally you end up getting a gravity of 1400 as lot of distilled water is evaporated during this process due to heat being generated. You can make later adjustments using distilled water once Acid has cooled down as at that time no heat will be generated. Always remember that battery will show increased gravity once charged and reduced gravity once discharged. Initially aim for gravity of 1250 and then you can take the reading after a week and make fine adjustments by using electrolyte prepared earlier of 1400 gravity or 1350. Always pour Acid on distilled Water not distilled water on Acid. Wear Rough Clothes, Glasses and gloves if possible. Keep the Acid and Mixture out from the reach of Children. Lot of heat would be generated during this process so be very careful. Always Use plastic Container not Metal. Mixture will take minimum 24 hours to cool down. Never pour the mixture inside the battery once it?s hot. 64 % distilled water should be Mixed with 36 % Acid by Volume. You may end up getting a gravity of 1400. Keep hydrometer with you and only check once fluid has cooled down. You can perform later adjustments by pouring more distilled water on the mixture once it has cooled down and at that time no heat will be generated. Use Plastic bottles to store the mixture. Always Label it as ?Very Dangerous Sulphuric Acid with Gravity ABC ?. Keep it in safe place where no one other then you can touch it. Container used for producing the mixture should never again be used for taking bath. Don?t allow anyone to misuse the Acid for hurting anyone. HOW TO PERFORM FLUSH Procedure which I follow is that I fully charge my batteries, then take the batteries outside, drained the electrolyte in proper sewerage line while I already have an access to new electrolyte which was prepared earlier before performing this procedure and have the batteries flushed it with tap water 5-6 times. Later put the battery in upside down position for 30 minutes before pouring new electrolyte back in. DIAGNOSING ISSUES WITH UPS SYSTEM (BATTERIES AND UPS) KNOW YOUR SITUATION: Electricity outrage in Pakistan varies, sometimes after every 6 hours in few places and sometime after every hour for next three hours. UPS might be perfectly tuned but may fail to cope up with changing situation. Charging rate which may be properly set up for winter season or for few areas may not be able to cope up with high demand once electricity outrage will be more frequent. Under these scenario, first your ups may not be able to give desired performance and secondly your batteries may be exposed to damage which may result from remaining discharge for an extended period. It is very important that two variables must be properly adjusted on UPS, the first one is low cut off voltages and second one is the charging rate which may require adjustments as per the situation as highlighted above. LOW CUT OFF VOLTAGE: This variable is set to 10.3Volts and UPS should trip once voltage on battery terminals reaches this voltage. As extended discharging will surely damage the batteries very soon once voltage on battery terminal will drop below 10.3Volts. CHARGING RATE: this much be adjusted in accordance to your situation, you should know the maximum allowable charging rate, slow charging is good for batteries but once electric outrage is more frequent and for long duration then you should try to increase the charging rate till ups is able to charge the batteries within hour or two. For example, If you have two batteries of pheonix UGS 215, whereas the company?s wesite site says that its AMP-HR rating is 160AMP-HR and charging rate is set to 7Amperes then use the formula of maximum allowable charging rate AMP-HR/10 which in this case comes out to be: 160/10=16, try to increase the charging rate till 10 Amperes or 14 Amp but never exceed 16 Amperes. Then try to observe if next time UPS charges the battery in needed time or not and correspondingly you can make the fine adjustments. Charging rate is set by attaching the AMP meter on battery wire, then slightly turning the charging rate variable on PCB board while ups is still charging the batteries. Either it?s going to increase or decrease which you can easily see on amp meter. TWO MOST IMPORTANT VARIABLES: CHARGING RATE AND CUT OFF VOLTAGE People who says that their batteries dies within 3 to 6 months or they start to experience low backup time very soon then they should cross verify the cut off voltage at which charging stops and the charging rate. If your these two variables are set properly then your battery will not give you unexpected surprises and plus it has a good electrolyte then trust me, it will easily go above 2.5 years provided battery does not have any manufacturing fault. THINGS WHICH ONE SHOULD CONSIDER BEFORE BUYING A UPS SYSTEM AND SELECTING BATTERIES FOR IT. Imported ups will definitely will save you from many problems, as you won?t have to worry about cut off voltage at which charging stops, low cut off voltage at which ups should trip, load setting which indicates the maximum load which ups can take, output voltages if you want to run your TV or computers on ups but still people do make a mistake even once buying the imported UPS system. Which is that they don?t consider reading the maximum charging rate at which ups starts to charge the batteries and they correspondingly don?t select the correct battery. Most of the imported ups system starts to charge the batteries at 10-12 Volts which implies that you should never buy a battery whose AMP-HR rating is below 150 least. Charging rate on imported UPS are fixed and can?t be manually adjusted. Good thing is that it charges the battery at three different charging rates which corresponds to the voltages on battery terminals which is a desirable thing. IF YOU WANT TO RUN YOUR TV?S AND COMPUTERS ON UPS SYSTEMS: IMPORTED UPS Even if batteries are not in good health, imported ups will maintain the output voltage to 220 and would trip once batteries will discharge to a limit as set by factory. So we have no problem here. LOCAL UPS: But with local UPS systems, output voltage will drop once batteries are going to discharge. You should not set the output voltage of local ups to 220 volts once batteries are fully charged as by time once batteries will be completely discharge with voltage on battery terminal to be around 10.3 Volts then maybe your output voltage will drop to 160 to 180 Volts. That?s why it is important that output voltage maybe set to 250 or 255 volts so by the time once voltage on battery terminals should reach 10.3 Volts then output voltage may still be above 220 Volts. Otherwise, you will keep on experiencing burnt WIFI adopters, mobile charging adopters, wifi devices and TV?S. Output voltage on ups is adjusted by fully charging the batteries and removing every device off from its output just in-order to be safe. Then you need to insert the voltmeter in its output and adjust the output voltage to a desired value using the onboard variable. SOLAR INVERTERS, ON-GRID, OFF-GRID, BATTERIES COMPATIBILITY WITH INVERTER AND SOLAR PANELS   Not all solar inverters are compatible with solar panels or for matter of fact goes well with any sort of batteries may it be dry or lead acid batteries. Things will work, but will eventually ruin your battery bank very quickly for reasons discussed in thread below. It is very important that one carefully selects the inverter which is able to provide the correct voltage needed to charge the batteries. Things such as inverter allows you to wire few solar panels in series, your load, inverter type, how different systems are integrated with each other at battery level, what should be your total panels output needed to charge the batteries and simultaneously power the attached load such that it does not kills your battery bank or leave it uncharged is discussed and how could your replace your ups with hybrid solar inverter which means saving in terms of electricity bills due to UPS. I be happy to extend my experience and knowledge on subject matter either on thread below or on same thread. 13https://www.pakwheels.com/forums/mechanical-electrical/276598-diy-solar-panel-installation-controller-selection-batteries13 DISTILLED AND DE-IONIZED WATER SUPPLIERS I will start adding the locations and address of agencies which provide distilled and de-ionized water here. Right now one of the members (@stonedsaint) have provided this address and I have verified this by calling them as they are offering de-ionized water at Rs 9/Liter. You should take your bottle along with you otherwise they charge Rs 500 non-refundable for big plastic container.

Comments: Rs 9/Liter seems like a good deal. Pyrochem provides Electrolyte prepared with De-ionized water, those who are based in Lahore can contact them. Delivery Guy, according to one member @deltoid61 says that they may be able to provide in other cities. Pyrochem (Pvt) Limited, 96-Bank Square Market, Model Town, Lahore - Pakistan. Tel: +92-42-35839278 / 35854646, Fax: +92-42-35887366 E-mail: info@pyrochem.com.pk Here is number of delivery Guy 0300-4729119 ASK FOR 4% TO 5% DISCOUNT ON ORIGINAL BATTERY PRICE IF YOU INTEND TO PREPARE YOUR OWN ELECTROLYTE OR BUY IT FROM ANOTHER SOURCE Once you have confirmed the final price on a given battery then ask them for a discount if you intend to prepare the electrolyte yourself or buy It from somewhere else. most battery shops provide the discount happily if you want to use your own electrolyte. I do it all the time once I buy a new battery and @deltoid61 has reported the same on post no: 1298 WRONG FLUSH PROCEDURE AND PRACTICES I really find it hard to replay every one as people are making all sorts of mistake while making the flush and most of them are doing it blindly not knowing if it?s going to be successful or not. kindly judge before doing so and won?t be successful under the condition. You had been using dirty electrolyte right from start and batteries have gone bad or impurities are coated on the cells leaving very little active material behind. Batteries have died because of slow charging rate such that it enters into next cycle of load shedding without being properly charged or cutoff Voltage is badly set such as 27 Volts for double battery system. Or batteries are damaged because of overcharging such that one of the cells are now damaged. Or batteries have outlived its useful life and very less active material is left on the cells. You may perform flush You can still perform flush if you know batteries had the bad electrolyte and still all cells are ok and now you want to replace it with good one. Once charging rate, cutoff voltage is properly setup and you feel in-between that now backup time has started to drop and then do it immediately. MAIN REASON, LIGHT FLUSH IS PERFORMED. As the battery sheds its lead to the bottom of the container, a conductive layer forms, and once the contaminated material fills the allotted space at bottom of the battery and conductive material reaches the plates then creates a shorting effect and sometimes conductive material gets stuck between two plates creating a short and drains the battery fast. This condition only happens on a batteries which properly charges and discharges unlike batteries which never gets a chance to charge properly or die prematurely because of formation of sulfate crystals. Perform flush, once your charging system is properly adjusted right from start and you have noticed that backup time is dropping then immediately perform flush so that you can eliminate above factor by doing so. I have been successful number of times in restoring the backup time as I understand what I am doing. Even then you go ahead and perform flush without being successful then note that above factor was not responsible for reduced backup time. Do it before a damage has occurred as nothing you will do later will bring a bad cell back to its life. SPECIFIC GRAVITY AND PEOPLES CONFUSION Electrolyte specific gravity is an indicator which tells that batteries are good or bad. To make it simple, just like we use voltmeter to measure dc voltage on battery terminals and AC output voltage, we use amp-meter to measure the charging rate on batteries as these values helps us tune our UPS, the same way Electrolyte specific gravity measured with help of hydrometer tells us lot about how good your batteries are. It?s little tricky to draw conclusions out after reading the specific gravity so don?t start getting worried very quickly. So understand it this way, that you cannot answer few question by a single answer, same is the case with S.G reading. You need to consider following before drawing any conclusion. Specific gravity reading should always be taken on a fully charged batteries, as during discharging, sulfuric acid within electrolyte gets absorbed in cells whereas during charging sulfuric acid comes out to mix with the electrolyte within batteries so you will never observe a good value if you will take those readings on a fully discharged batteries, may your batteries have no issues and you may keep on getting worried for nothing. Once, new electrolyte is added in batteries (on new batteries or after flush) with ups properly tuned, then it takes approximately two weeks for batteries to show its true S.G value. This is because, the sulfuric acid content within the electrolyte is heavy and goes down to settle in bottom. Within repeated charging and discharging, it gives ample chance for both the contents in electrolyte which is sulfuric acid and distilled water to mix with each other. If you know, your UPS is properly turned then don?t get immediately worried after adding the electrolyte in batteries. Variation of SPECIFIC GRAVITY between different cells straightaway points towards a problem with one or with more cells. You can jump to the conclusion directly here. Kindly take into account, if I misquoted somewhere that if you need to increase the specific gravity then add electrolyte with higher specific gravity into it. Normally if electrolyte was prepared with right adjustments in start then you don?t need to do this throughout the life span of battery so always add distilled water if level of electrolyte drops later at any stage. Later if you see that all the cells are showing 1250 or 1230 specific gravity except one which is showing 1160 then that?s an indicator that this cell is bad. Adding electrolyte with higher specific gravity will not solve the problem. It?s up-to you, if you want to perform the flush or any other exercise which may recover the cell before it completely goes bad. ISSUE WITH BATTERY REPAIR SHOPS: INSTALLING NEW LEAD PLATES Analyze the issue, every battery designed or manufactured is on certain AMP-HR ratings that is dictated by cells cross section area, thickness and lead plates in every cell. Now if you have a 200 AMP-HR battery which you have given to the repair shop, then how do you expect that to attach the same numbers of plates in every cell that they will use the same cross section area and thickness depending upon the AMP-HR ratings? These repair people are mostly uneducated and they have standard plates which they fit in every battery thus this alters the original AMP-HR ratings. Once a battery which used to be off 200 AMP-HR rating was charged at 15 Amperes of current by UPS has now became maybe of 70 AMP-HR rating and has become unfit to be charged at the same rate. God knows, where they buy the lead plates from and what about its quality s and above all, I once got the job done from them on two of my 200 Amp-hr batteries and lead plates which they fit in were of a very small size as compared to what it came from factory originally. And they charged me RS 4000 for single battery, not worth the time and money to be wasted on it and above all it died within first two months with much reduce backup time. DEEP CYCLE BATTERIES VS ORDINARY STARTER LEAD ACID BATTERIES: Difference between deep cycle batteries and ordinary lead acid batteries are the plate specification, deep cycle batteries have been designed for UPS/INVERTERS, solar panels and to be used with wind turbines, have think plates and can considerably discharge to a lower limit such as 50% of the batteries capacity where as ordinary lead acid batteries can only be discharged to 80% then they would require charging again, have thin plates with large surface area and very good for cranking vehicles as it can deliver high voltage for a very short duration of time as needed for the application. So there is a tradeoff between cold cranking voltages and backup time. Recently I have seen phoenix batteries in Pakistan producing UGS series specifically designed for UPS/INVERTERS. Although, the site does not clearly labels its as deep cycle batteries but still should be preferred over ordinarily lead acid batteries because of thicker plate size as desired and will surely last for a longer time. I am sure, they will not try to rip people by increasing their price just for heck free publicity they are getting from here. DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 12 VOLT UPS AND 24 VOLT UPS: Many find this confusing, so you can understand this way that lead acid battery manufacturers develop batteries in 12Volt format, so now UPS manufacturer?s designs a system in-order to get connected to 12 Volt battery or two 12 Volts batteries connected in series to make it a 24 Volts system just in-order to double the backup time for those who desire such system. Connecting batteries in series doubles the voltage but AMP-HR rating for the system would remain same. Which just says that formula which is applicable for calculating the maximum allowable charging rate for 12 Volt battery bank will also apply to a 24 Volt battery bank. Let me explain this with example, if you have 160 AMP-HR battery connected with 12Volts system then maximum allowable charging rate for this case is 160/10=16, now if you have two 160AMP-HR batteries connected in series on 24Volt system then again maximum allowable charging rate will again be 16 amperes for this setup, it?s just that now you can run the same load for double the time on 24Volts setup. If novices does not wants to confuse himself, then don?t read further. You must be thinking that I can connect two batteries of same capacity on 12 Volts UPS system in parallel configuration which will also double the backup time. Then answer is that you are right, but here you will have to add up the AMP-HR capacities of both the batteries in-order to calculate the new maximum allowable charging rate and discharging rate. In parallel configuration with two 160 AMP-HR batteries, you can now charge your system at 32 amperes of maximum allowable charging rate as current divides in parallel configuration. So in short, if your 12 volts one battery could have lit maximum 15 of the energy savers for one hours than 24 battery bank can light the same for 2 hours. Now, once you will add two batteries in parallel on 12 Volts system then you can increase the number of bulbs to 30, can either lit those 30 for one hour or turn 15 off to light yet another 15 for two hours. Hope, you must have got it as I could not make it simpler this this. P.S: in above example, I have ignored the limitations imposed by UPS on a battery bank, like few have safety switches, which will go off if you will try to light 30 energy savers for 1 hour on 12 Volts system with two batteries in parallel. WHAT DOES 700W, 1000W AND 3000W UPS MEAN: I don?t think, that local ups manufacturer or local shops who prepare the transformers or individual parts understands what it really means by term 700W. But in case of imported UPS, we surely do know. LIMITS IMPOSED ON UPS BY MANUFACTURER The word 700W says that (P=VI, 700=220*I, I=3.181 Amperes) at any moment, if you will exceed the load by 3.181 ac amperes, the UPS will not handle it and has a safety switch which will go off or UPS will shut down without giving you a warning. Purpose of this limit is that beyond 3.181amperes of current, you ups equipment can get damaged so safety switch will go off, but there are limits on batteries as well and we want the ups to shut down if that is also being abused as otherwise we may experience voltage drop on output lines which will damage the attached electrical systems. MAXIMUM LIMITS OF YOUR BATTERIES Lead Acid batteries its self-have defined specs which clearly quotes amount of maximum current it can handle. Formula says that lead acid batteries should not be discharged at rate AMP-HR rating/6, or AMP-HR rating/4 or in extreme AMP-HR rating/3, below that you will definitely experience abnormal behavior such as dimming of lights, burnt tv?s, adopters, wifi devices. EXAMPLE: Maximum discharging rate: 200/6 turns out to be 66.666 dc amperes. Formula roughly says that you should not go near this limit but if you do, it may handle this for a while, exceeding this will immediately let you have it. Pin=Pout, 12*66.6666=220 *I ac, I ac=3.63 Now, after reading above two readings, you can clearly make out that this UPS will go well with 200 amp-hr batteries and will protect you against an undesirable voltage drop. PURPOSE OF LIMITS: dimming of lights is an undesirable thing on ups especially if you have attached power adopters, TV?s on it. If family member accidently connects an Iron on UPS line, then you would want the entire system to shutdown rather than experiencing a voltage drop as that can burn any delicate electrical instrument attached to your line. RULE OF THUMB: MAXIMUM LOAD LIMIT OF BATTERIES> Load LIMIT IMPOSED on UPS LOCAL UPS: local UPS has a variable on UPS card, through which you can easily make this adjustment. UPS shops has a circuit board on which they have different bulbs of different ratings, by turning on different bulbs of different ratings, they can make this adjustment on ups cards provided if you ask them to do so forcefully. PERSONALLY: if I had to buy a local ups, I would buy a 3000watt ups or maybe 2000watt, considering my 160AMP-HR bank, I would calculate things like this, amp-hr/4, 160/4=40, Pin=Pout, 12*40=220*I ac, I ac=2.181, I would have my ups trip by manually tuning if Ac load exceeds 2.181 amperes. TOTAL DISSOLVED SOLIDS (TDS) IN WATER AND ITS IMPLICATIONS ON BATTERY Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) are the total amount of mobile charged ions. Including minerals, salts, or metals dissolved in given volume of water expressed in units of mg per unit volume of water or also referred as parts per million (ppm) In short, batter water is a normal water from which dissolved salts and minerals have been removed either by a process known as distillation or de-ionization. Ideally battery water should have a TDS value varying from 0-10 ppm Ideal drinking water should have TDS value between 0-500.  RED BATTERY WATER SOLD IN MARKET IS A FRAUD. Recently after having bought the TDS meter from aliexpress.com, I got the chance to test things after having bought 100 liters of de-ionized water from a reliable supplier based in plot#277, street 1, I-9/3 and a regular bottle of battery water being sold in open market for Rs. 30 per 200ml for sake of testing. To my surprised, the RED battery water sold in market had a TDS value of 615 whereas home tab water had a TDS value of 339 and de-ionized water bought from source mentioned on main thread had the TDS value of 3. In-order to verify things, I further went to 6 different shops and bought the red colored battery water from different sources and non-had a TDS value below 500. You can very well understand that you being ripped in market, made to buy water which is not even near fit for its intended use. TDS VALUES OF DE-IONIZED WATER (BATTERY WATER) AVAILABLE IN MARKET FROM DIFFERENT MANUFACTURER: Volta battery water?s TDS value turned out to be 466 ppm posted on message no 2259, page 113 on this thread with pictures and compared with Nestle water with TDS value of 176. 2. Guard battery water?s TDS value turned out to be 345 ppm posted on message no 2272, page 114 on this thread with pictures and compared with my Home Tab water with TDS value of 195. Aone Spark battery water TDS value turned out to be 741 ppm posted on message no 2304, page 116 on this thread with pictures and compared with my Home Tab water with TDS value of 217 this time as expected as this is a running water. So clearly Aone Spark battery water is also not fit for batteries. AGS Battery Tonic TDS value turned out to be 005 ppm posted on message no 2327, page 117 on this thread with pictures by @ Me4726. I am glad to see, least AGS is not cheating on her buyers. Later, I also got a chance to perform test on AGS tonic bought from another shop and TDS value turned out to be 004 ppm, consistent with earlier reading taken by a member. Valley Ultra Distilled water, contact no: 051-4430067, 051-4101005, email address: nfsvalley@hotmail.com TDS results turned out to be 004 ppm posted on message no: 2322, page 117 with results posted by @asjdsm. I also have taken the TDS reading and picture can also be seen in last image of main body of thread in a cup with a TDS meter inserted. Battery water being sold under the name of “BATTERY TONIC with AGS battery’s picture on it” has TDS value turned out to be 339 ppm posted on message no 2875, page 144 on this thread with picture. TDS value of De-ionized water from Pryo Chemicals turned out to be 32ppm, test was done on a single sample of De-ionized water bottle bought from a PSO pump in DHA Lahore. I will keep on adding the results here, few brothers have ordered the TDS meter online and they would be able to re-verify the readings later. Anyway, above is a disturbing trend, since most of us don?t have a choice so I would advise you to prefer Nestle Drinking water over this crap being sold in market to top up the batteries for time being till we are not able to locate a good supplier.","talhawaleed;2554633: Dear Whiteangel, Most probable cause might be that your UPS has been trying hard to charge a battery with almost no fluid inside. It can also happen once your SP >1300 or below SP<1150. In this scenario your UPS is trying hard to charge your batteries at high AMPS (25 AMPS) which is producing excessive heat during this process which obviously is not good for your batteries and secondly you are wasting a lot of power which should be enough to run two Air Conditioners. First sign of excessive charging is appearance of black color below the battery caps which is a good signal that you are abusing your battery and wasting power. Sometimes your batteries are fine with right Specific gravity and fluid level but your UPS requires adjustment such that it should stop charging once output of single battery reaches 12.8 Volts and yes off course it should not be charging your batteries@ 25 AMPS. All the local UPS sold in market does not come along with fine adjustments but you have to ask these technicians to adjust these variables and test them before you buy these UPS. You also need to observer your UPS using a Voltmeter for first week of purchase before you move onto other things in life. couldnt have said it better myself, the other fact that can turn battery plates black is the acid mixture itself, IF the acid was prepared with black (cheap acid) it will turn the plates grayish black over a time period of 1 week. And as talha and I am are constantly saying - you need to have the acid mixture of highest quality - (Its what is literally making the battery function properly). When people come and ask me how I can start german/european diesels with local normal sized pakistani batteries my answer to them is what you sow is what you reap - good input = good output, bad input = bad output its an old wives tale that 90AH DIN Type Pakistani Exide cannot start Mercedes Benz 300D in winter - nopes - IT CAN, if the mixture was prepped properly and the battery charged fully before putting into service.",,
"PERSONAL EXPERIENCE Three years back I got interested in analyzing the procedure which is used by battery maintenance shops. They purchase Sulfuric in drums and then mix it with tap water in 66 % by volume. They say that chemical reaction causes the water to boil which remove the oxygen molecules from the mixture hence results in giving up gravity of 1250 which they pour it in car batteries. Batteries run fine for year or two whereas I think if it is all about removing impurities from car batteries then they are making a mistake by adding tap water which would off course boil the water but would not guarantee the removal of impurities present inside the water. I have six batteries of 200 Amps each in my office which can support 15 computers during heavy load shedding. In order to overcome the Myth, I purchased a drum of Sulfuric Acid and have mixed it with distilled water which I have produced it in my own lab. I took all my batteries outside and have flushed it with tab water to remove all the deposits present inside the batteries. Flush was performed multiple times then batteries were refilled with Acid of 1250-1270 gravity prepared within my office compound. Since, electrolyte was prepared with distilled water and UPS was properly adjusted so even at the end of the third year my batteries are able to provide 90 % backup time as compared to the time of purchase, even after excessive load shedding of 1 hour?s; 5-6 times a day from last three years. Flush is a periodic exercise which is performed at least once a year also I have adjusted the output of my UPS to charge per battery at rate not more than 8 Amps. So basically the right ups settings along with a good electrolyte and distilled water prepared in my own lab used for topping up the batteries later made the difference. That?s is not something difficult as my entire intent is to educate my audience regarding these simple techniques which will give you years of trouble free service. NOTE: ELECTROLYTE GRAVITY IS ADJUSTED ONCE IN START, LATER YOU POUR DE-IONIZED OR DISTILLED WATER FOR TOPPING UP. CHANGE IN S.G LATER IN ANY CELL POINTS TOWARDS A PROBLEM AREA. AT THIS STAGE, YOU NEED TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE EITHER BY LOOKING AT UPS ADJUSTMENT, EITHER IT?S BECAUSE OF BAD ELECTROLYTE OR NEEDS A FLUSH. LESSONS LEARN: 1) If electrolyte is prepared with tab water then batteries will die much earlier than its actual life. 2) Wrong UPS settings is yet another major factor which contributes in killing your batteries much earlier. 3) With wrong combinations of both, you will start to experience problems with batteries within first three months. Having understood the issue, My two 220 AMP-HR batteries connected with my UPS at home powers the entire house lighting, fans and runs flawlessly without much reducing the electrolyte and backup time even after two years. HOW TO ADJUST UPS Most of us are using the similar local UPS sold in market. The only problem with these UPS is that they have few parameters which most of the times are not adjusted properly. Now once you buy these UPS then try to get it adjusted at shop before bringing it to your home. By rule of thumb the maximum allowable charging rate of Lead Acid batteries are its Amp Hour rating divided by 10. For 145 AH battery; the correct charging rate is 145 AH/10 is 14.5 Volts. Anything above this would be termed as fast charging which would damage your batteries in long run. Slow charging is good for batteries but if intensity of load shedding is frequent then probably batteries won?t be prepared before it enters next cycle of load shedding. So you need to look into your circumstances before adjusting this figure but in circumstances you should go above maximum allowable charging rate. You should always ask local UPS shops to adjust these parameters according to specification given below. If you are interested in learning them then ask him to do it in front of you. Mark those parameters with paper tape so that you don?t forget once you do it yourself. Also try to work these settings in your mind first so that you may directly dictate the electrician. These UPS have a PCB card which has many variables. These variables can be adjusted using a screw driver. During load shedding the Output of the UPS is much more than normal Voltage. Adjust the variables such that your Output Voltage should never exceed 265 Volts once batteries are fully charged and put into backup mode. Adjust such that once output voltage reaches 220 Volts then your UPS should trigger the alarm and should shutdown within 10 seconds. Adjust the charging rate of each battery such that (AMP HOUR rating divided by 10). E.g For 200 AMP-HR batteries, I can keep it somewhere closer to 15 Amperes but will never exceed 20 amperes. Slow charging is very good for batteries but look into your circumstances as batteries will take more time to charge its self and you need to the batteries to be prepared for next cycle of load shedding. UPS should stop charging your batteries once the output voltage two batteries connected in series reaches 28 Volts and for single battery UPS system, it reaches 14 Volts. This is termed as cutoff Voltage. During Load shedding, once output of batteries (where two batteries are connected in Series) reaches 21 Volts then Alarm should trigger and UPS must be shut down immediately. Also note the output of UPS at that instance as it should not be less than 220 Volts otherwise sensitive electronic equipments such as TV?s, computers and routers will start to restart its self. Always keep your UPS line separate from main line. Your UPS should shutdown immediately if load exceeds the maximum capacity. UPS shops have different bulbs installed on board with different Powers to adjust these settings on UPS system. Always test under full load so that you are aware about the maximum load your UPS can take. Now, your computers should be safe under these configurations. You will need a good quality Voltmeter and AMP meter. Since chemical properties of battery?s changes the entire year so you will have to check your tuning after every few months which you can easily do with help of a Voltmeter, Amp-meter & hydrometer. PREPARING ELECTROLYTE: I don?t recommend that you prepare the electrolyte at home as mixing sulfuric acid with distilled water produces a lot of heat which can severely hurt any individual. If you can buy the electrolyte of 1250 gravity from some company like PRYO chemicals then that?s a best possible scenario. Otherwise, follow below. HOW TO PRODUCE DISTILLED WATER It is very easy to produce distilled water at home. By distilled water we simply refer to the water which is heated then it changes its form into steam. Steam should be allowed to pass through some system where it can condense so that it may change its form back into liquid and this liquid can be collected in some separate container. This liquid will be free from all sorts of impurities and is called distilled water. I have used a pressure cooker, air conditioning coils, rubber pipes, two plastic containers one for dipping the coils into cold water so that steam inside the coil can change its form back into liquid and other end connected to rubber pipe so that now distilled water can be collected into a second plastic container. HOW TO MIX ACID WITH DISTILLED WATER Specific gravity is measured in (kg/cu.m) for your reference as I won?t be repeating these symbols during this topic afterwards. Water has a specific gravity of 1000 where as Sulphuric acid has specific gravity of 1800. Once you mix 66% (in volume) of distilled water in 34% (in volume) Sulphuric Acid then you should get a gravity of 1240. But normally you end up getting a gravity of 1400 as lot of distilled water is evaporated during this process due to heat being generated. You can make later adjustments using distilled water once Acid has cooled down as at that time no heat will be generated. Always remember that battery will show increased gravity once charged and reduced gravity once discharged. Initially aim for gravity of 1250 and then you can take the reading after a week and make fine adjustments by using electrolyte prepared earlier of 1400 gravity or 1350. Always pour Acid on distilled Water not distilled water on Acid. Wear Rough Clothes, Glasses and gloves if possible. Keep the Acid and Mixture out from the reach of Children. Lot of heat would be generated during this process so be very careful. Always Use plastic Container not Metal. Mixture will take minimum 24 hours to cool down. Never pour the mixture inside the battery once it?s hot. 64 % distilled water should be Mixed with 36 % Acid by Volume. You may end up getting a gravity of 1400. Keep hydrometer with you and only check once fluid has cooled down. You can perform later adjustments by pouring more distilled water on the mixture once it has cooled down and at that time no heat will be generated. Use Plastic bottles to store the mixture. Always Label it as ?Very Dangerous Sulphuric Acid with Gravity ABC ?. Keep it in safe place where no one other then you can touch it. Container used for producing the mixture should never again be used for taking bath. Don?t allow anyone to misuse the Acid for hurting anyone. HOW TO PERFORM FLUSH Procedure which I follow is that I fully charge my batteries, then take the batteries outside, drained the electrolyte in proper sewerage line while I already have an access to new electrolyte which was prepared earlier before performing this procedure and have the batteries flushed it with tap water 5-6 times. Later put the battery in upside down position for 30 minutes before pouring new electrolyte back in. DIAGNOSING ISSUES WITH UPS SYSTEM (BATTERIES AND UPS) KNOW YOUR SITUATION: Electricity outrage in Pakistan varies, sometimes after every 6 hours in few places and sometime after every hour for next three hours. UPS might be perfectly tuned but may fail to cope up with changing situation. Charging rate which may be properly set up for winter season or for few areas may not be able to cope up with high demand once electricity outrage will be more frequent. Under these scenario, first your ups may not be able to give desired performance and secondly your batteries may be exposed to damage which may result from remaining discharge for an extended period. It is very important that two variables must be properly adjusted on UPS, the first one is low cut off voltages and second one is the charging rate which may require adjustments as per the situation as highlighted above. LOW CUT OFF VOLTAGE: This variable is set to 10.3Volts and UPS should trip once voltage on battery terminals reaches this voltage. As extended discharging will surely damage the batteries very soon once voltage on battery terminal will drop below 10.3Volts. CHARGING RATE: this much be adjusted in accordance to your situation, you should know the maximum allowable charging rate, slow charging is good for batteries but once electric outrage is more frequent and for long duration then you should try to increase the charging rate till ups is able to charge the batteries within hour or two. For example, If you have two batteries of pheonix UGS 215, whereas the company?s wesite site says that its AMP-HR rating is 160AMP-HR and charging rate is set to 7Amperes then use the formula of maximum allowable charging rate AMP-HR/10 which in this case comes out to be: 160/10=16, try to increase the charging rate till 10 Amperes or 14 Amp but never exceed 16 Amperes. Then try to observe if next time UPS charges the battery in needed time or not and correspondingly you can make the fine adjustments. Charging rate is set by attaching the AMP meter on battery wire, then slightly turning the charging rate variable on PCB board while ups is still charging the batteries. Either it?s going to increase or decrease which you can easily see on amp meter. TWO MOST IMPORTANT VARIABLES: CHARGING RATE AND CUT OFF VOLTAGE People who says that their batteries dies within 3 to 6 months or they start to experience low backup time very soon then they should cross verify the cut off voltage at which charging stops and the charging rate. If your these two variables are set properly then your battery will not give you unexpected surprises and plus it has a good electrolyte then trust me, it will easily go above 2.5 years provided battery does not have any manufacturing fault. THINGS WHICH ONE SHOULD CONSIDER BEFORE BUYING A UPS SYSTEM AND SELECTING BATTERIES FOR IT. Imported ups will definitely will save you from many problems, as you won?t have to worry about cut off voltage at which charging stops, low cut off voltage at which ups should trip, load setting which indicates the maximum load which ups can take, output voltages if you want to run your TV or computers on ups but still people do make a mistake even once buying the imported UPS system. Which is that they don?t consider reading the maximum charging rate at which ups starts to charge the batteries and they correspondingly don?t select the correct battery. Most of the imported ups system starts to charge the batteries at 10-12 Volts which implies that you should never buy a battery whose AMP-HR rating is below 150 least. Charging rate on imported UPS are fixed and can?t be manually adjusted. Good thing is that it charges the battery at three different charging rates which corresponds to the voltages on battery terminals which is a desirable thing. IF YOU WANT TO RUN YOUR TV?S AND COMPUTERS ON UPS SYSTEMS: IMPORTED UPS Even if batteries are not in good health, imported ups will maintain the output voltage to 220 and would trip once batteries will discharge to a limit as set by factory. So we have no problem here. LOCAL UPS: But with local UPS systems, output voltage will drop once batteries are going to discharge. You should not set the output voltage of local ups to 220 volts once batteries are fully charged as by time once batteries will be completely discharge with voltage on battery terminal to be around 10.3 Volts then maybe your output voltage will drop to 160 to 180 Volts. That?s why it is important that output voltage maybe set to 250 or 255 volts so by the time once voltage on battery terminals should reach 10.3 Volts then output voltage may still be above 220 Volts. Otherwise, you will keep on experiencing burnt WIFI adopters, mobile charging adopters, wifi devices and TV?S. Output voltage on ups is adjusted by fully charging the batteries and removing every device off from its output just in-order to be safe. Then you need to insert the voltmeter in its output and adjust the output voltage to a desired value using the onboard variable. SOLAR INVERTERS, ON-GRID, OFF-GRID, BATTERIES COMPATIBILITY WITH INVERTER AND SOLAR PANELS   Not all solar inverters are compatible with solar panels or for matter of fact goes well with any sort of batteries may it be dry or lead acid batteries. Things will work, but will eventually ruin your battery bank very quickly for reasons discussed in thread below. It is very important that one carefully selects the inverter which is able to provide the correct voltage needed to charge the batteries. Things such as inverter allows you to wire few solar panels in series, your load, inverter type, how different systems are integrated with each other at battery level, what should be your total panels output needed to charge the batteries and simultaneously power the attached load such that it does not kills your battery bank or leave it uncharged is discussed and how could your replace your ups with hybrid solar inverter which means saving in terms of electricity bills due to UPS. I be happy to extend my experience and knowledge on subject matter either on thread below or on same thread. 13https://www.pakwheels.com/forums/mechanical-electrical/276598-diy-solar-panel-installation-controller-selection-batteries13 DISTILLED AND DE-IONIZED WATER SUPPLIERS I will start adding the locations and address of agencies which provide distilled and de-ionized water here. Right now one of the members (@stonedsaint) have provided this address and I have verified this by calling them as they are offering de-ionized water at Rs 9/Liter. You should take your bottle along with you otherwise they charge Rs 500 non-refundable for big plastic container. Location: Rawalpindi/Islamabad, Sector I-9 Mobile No: 03335685978 Landline Numbers: 051-4430067 & 051-4101005. Address: Plot#277,street#1,I-9/3,Industrial Area, Islamabad. Comments: Rs 9/Liter seems like a good deal. Pyrochem provides Electrolyte prepared with De-ionized water, those who are based in Lahore can contact them. Delivery Guy, according to one member @deltoid61 says that they may be able to provide in other cities. Pyrochem (Pvt) Limited, 96-Bank Square Market, Model Town, Lahore - Pakistan. Tel: +92-42-35839278 / 35854646, Fax: +92-42-35887366 E-mail: info@pyrochem.com.pk Here is number of delivery Guy 0300-4729119 ASK FOR 4% TO 5% DISCOUNT ON ORIGINAL BATTERY PRICE IF YOU INTEND TO PREPARE YOUR OWN ELECTROLYTE OR BUY IT FROM ANOTHER SOURCE Once you have confirmed the final price on a given battery then ask them for a discount if you intend to prepare the electrolyte yourself or buy It from somewhere else. most battery shops provide the discount happily if you want to use your own electrolyte. I do it all the time once I buy a new battery and @deltoid61 has reported the same on post no: 1298 WRONG FLUSH PROCEDURE AND PRACTICES I really find it hard to replay every one as people are making all sorts of mistake while making the flush and most of them are doing it blindly not knowing if it?s going to be successful or not. kindly judge before doing so and won?t be successful under the condition. You had been using dirty electrolyte right from start and batteries have gone bad or impurities are coated on the cells leaving very little active material behind. Batteries have died because of slow charging rate such that it enters into next cycle of load shedding without being properly charged or cutoff Voltage is badly set such as 27 Volts for double battery system. Or batteries are damaged because of overcharging such that one of the cells are now damaged. Or batteries have outlived its useful life and very less active material is left on the cells. You may perform flush You can still perform flush if you know batteries had the bad electrolyte and still all cells are ok and now you want to replace it with good one. Once charging rate, cutoff voltage is properly setup and you feel in-between that now backup time has started to drop and then do it immediately. MAIN REASON, LIGHT FLUSH IS PERFORMED. As the battery sheds its lead to the bottom of the container, a conductive layer forms, and once the contaminated material fills the allotted space at bottom of the battery and conductive material reaches the plates then creates a shorting effect and sometimes conductive material gets stuck between two plates creating a short and drains the battery fast. This condition only happens on a batteries which properly charges and discharges unlike batteries which never gets a chance to charge properly or die prematurely because of formation of sulfate crystals. Perform flush, once your charging system is properly adjusted right from start and you have noticed that backup time is dropping then immediately perform flush so that you can eliminate above factor by doing so. I have been successful number of times in restoring the backup time as I understand what I am doing. Even then you go ahead and perform flush without being successful then note that above factor was not responsible for reduced backup time. Do it before a damage has occurred as nothing you will do later will bring a bad cell back to its life. SPECIFIC GRAVITY AND PEOPLES CONFUSION Electrolyte specific gravity is an indicator which tells that batteries are good or bad. To make it simple, just like we use voltmeter to measure dc voltage on battery terminals and AC output voltage, we use amp-meter to measure the charging rate on batteries as these values helps us tune our UPS, the same way Electrolyte specific gravity measured with help of hydrometer tells us lot about how good your batteries are. It?s little tricky to draw conclusions out after reading the specific gravity so don?t start getting worried very quickly. So understand it this way, that you cannot answer few question by a single answer, same is the case with S.G reading. You need to consider following before drawing any conclusion. Specific gravity reading should always be taken on a fully charged batteries, as during discharging, sulfuric acid within electrolyte gets absorbed in cells whereas during charging sulfuric acid comes out to mix with the electrolyte within batteries so you will never observe a good value if you will take those readings on a fully discharged batteries, may your batteries have no issues and you may keep on getting worried for nothing. Once, new electrolyte is added in batteries (on new batteries or after flush) with ups properly tuned, then it takes approximately two weeks for batteries to show its true S.G value. This is because, the sulfuric acid content within the electrolyte is heavy and goes down to settle in bottom. Within repeated charging and discharging, it gives ample chance for both the contents in electrolyte which is sulfuric acid and distilled water to mix with each other. If you know, your UPS is properly turned then don?t get immediately worried after adding the electrolyte in batteries. Variation of SPECIFIC GRAVITY between different cells straightaway points towards a problem with one or with more cells. You can jump to the conclusion directly here. Kindly take into account, if I misquoted somewhere that if you need to increase the specific gravity then add electrolyte with higher specific gravity into it. Normally if electrolyte was prepared with right adjustments in start then you don?t need to do this throughout the life span of battery so always add distilled water if level of electrolyte drops later at any stage. Later if you see that all the cells are showing 1250 or 1230 specific gravity except one which is showing 1160 then that?s an indicator that this cell is bad. Adding electrolyte with higher specific gravity will not solve the problem. It?s up-to you, if you want to perform the flush or any other exercise which may recover the cell before it completely goes bad. ISSUE WITH BATTERY REPAIR SHOPS: INSTALLING NEW LEAD PLATES Analyze the issue, every battery designed or manufactured is on certain AMP-HR ratings that is dictated by cells cross section area, thickness and lead plates in every cell. Now if you have a 200 AMP-HR battery which you have given to the repair shop, then how do you expect that to attach the same numbers of plates in every cell that they will use the same cross section area and thickness depending upon the AMP-HR ratings? These repair people are mostly uneducated and they have standard plates which they fit in every battery thus this alters the original AMP-HR ratings. Once a battery which used to be off 200 AMP-HR rating was charged at 15 Amperes of current by UPS has now became maybe of 70 AMP-HR rating and has become unfit to be charged at the same rate. God knows, where they buy the lead plates from and what about its quality s and above all, I once got the job done from them on two of my 200 Amp-hr batteries and lead plates which they fit in were of a very small size as compared to what it came from factory originally. And they charged me RS 4000 for single battery, not worth the time and money to be wasted on it and above all it died within first two months with much reduce backup time. DEEP CYCLE BATTERIES VS ORDINARY STARTER LEAD ACID BATTERIES: Difference between deep cycle batteries and ordinary lead acid batteries are the plate specification, deep cycle batteries have been designed for UPS/INVERTERS, solar panels and to be used with wind turbines, have think plates and can considerably discharge to a lower limit such as 50% of the batteries capacity where as ordinary lead acid batteries can only be discharged to 80% then they would require charging again, have thin plates with large surface area and very good for cranking vehicles as it can deliver high voltage for a very short duration of time as needed for the application. So there is a tradeoff between cold cranking voltages and backup time. Recently I have seen phoenix batteries in Pakistan producing UGS series specifically designed for UPS/INVERTERS. Although, the site does not clearly labels its as deep cycle batteries but still should be preferred over ordinarily lead acid batteries because of thicker plate size as desired and will surely last for a longer time. I am sure, they will not try to rip people by increasing their price just for heck free publicity they are getting from here. DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 12 VOLT UPS AND 24 VOLT UPS: Many find this confusing, so you can understand this way that lead acid battery manufacturers develop batteries in 12Volt format, so now UPS manufacturer?s designs a system in-order to get connected to 12 Volt battery or two 12 Volts batteries connected in series to make it a 24 Volts system just in-order to double the backup time for those who desire such system. Connecting batteries in series doubles the voltage but AMP-HR rating for the system would remain same. Which just says that formula which is applicable for calculating the maximum allowable charging rate for 12 Volt battery bank will also apply to a 24 Volt battery bank. Let me explain this with example, if you have 160 AMP-HR battery connected with 12Volts system then maximum allowable charging rate for this case is 160/10=16, now if you have two 160AMP-HR batteries connected in series on 24Volt system then again maximum allowable charging rate will again be 16 amperes for this setup, it?s just that now you can run the same load for double the time on 24Volts setup. If novices does not wants to confuse himself, then don?t read further. You must be thinking that I can connect two batteries of same capacity on 12 Volts UPS system in parallel configuration which will also double the backup time. Then answer is that you are right, but here you will have to add up the AMP-HR capacities of both the batteries in-order to calculate the new maximum allowable charging rate and discharging rate. In parallel configuration with two 160 AMP-HR batteries, you can now charge your system at 32 amperes of maximum allowable charging rate as current divides in parallel configuration. So in short, if your 12 volts one battery could have lit maximum 15 of the energy savers for one hours than 24 battery bank can light the same for 2 hours. Now, once you will add two batteries in parallel on 12 Volts system then you can increase the number of bulbs to 30, can either lit those 30 for one hour or turn 15 off to light yet another 15 for two hours. Hope, you must have got it as I could not make it simpler this this. P.S: in above example, I have ignored the limitations imposed by UPS on a battery bank, like few have safety switches, which will go off if you will try to light 30 energy savers for 1 hour on 12 Volts system with two batteries in parallel. WHAT DOES 700W, 1000W AND 3000W UPS MEAN: I don?t think, that local ups manufacturer or local shops who prepare the transformers or individual parts understands what it really means by term 700W. But in case of imported UPS, we surely do know. LIMITS IMPOSED ON UPS BY MANUFACTURER The word 700W says that (P=VI, 700=220*I, I=3.181 Amperes) at any moment, if you will exceed the load by 3.181 ac amperes, the UPS will not handle it and has a safety switch which will go off or UPS will shut down without giving you a warning. Purpose of this limit is that beyond 3.181amperes of current, you ups equipment can get damaged so safety switch will go off, but there are limits on batteries as well and we want the ups to shut down if that is also being abused as otherwise we may experience voltage drop on output lines which will damage the attached electrical systems. MAXIMUM LIMITS OF YOUR BATTERIES Lead Acid batteries its self-have defined specs which clearly quotes amount of maximum current it can handle. Formula says that lead acid batteries should not be discharged at rate AMP-HR rating/6, or AMP-HR rating/4 or in extreme AMP-HR rating/3, below that you will definitely experience abnormal behavior such as dimming of lights, burnt tv?s, adopters, wifi devices. EXAMPLE: Maximum discharging rate: 200/6 turns out to be 66.666 dc amperes. Formula roughly says that you should not go near this limit but if you do, it may handle this for a while, exceeding this will immediately let you have it. Pin=Pout, 12*66.6666=220 *I ac, I ac=3.63 Now, after reading above two readings, you can clearly make out that this UPS will go well with 200 amp-hr batteries and will protect you against an undesirable voltage drop. PURPOSE OF LIMITS: dimming of lights is an undesirable thing on ups especially if you have attached power adopters, TV?s on it. If family member accidently connects an Iron on UPS line, then you would want the entire system to shutdown rather than experiencing a voltage drop as that can burn any delicate electrical instrument attached to your line. RULE OF THUMB: MAXIMUM LOAD LIMIT OF BATTERIES> Load LIMIT IMPOSED on UPS LOCAL UPS: local UPS has a variable on UPS card, through which you can easily make this adjustment. UPS shops has a circuit board on which they have different bulbs of different ratings, by turning on different bulbs of different ratings, they can make this adjustment on ups cards provided if you ask them to do so forcefully. PERSONALLY: if I had to buy a local ups, I would buy a 3000watt ups or maybe 2000watt, considering my 160AMP-HR bank, I would calculate things like this, amp-hr/4, 160/4=40, Pin=Pout, 12*40=220*I ac, I ac=2.181, I would have my ups trip by manually tuning if Ac load exceeds 2.181 amperes. TOTAL DISSOLVED SOLIDS (TDS) IN WATER AND ITS IMPLICATIONS ON BATTERY Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) are the total amount of mobile charged ions. Including minerals, salts, or metals dissolved in given volume of water expressed in units of mg per unit volume of water or also referred as parts per million (ppm) In short, batter water is a normal water from which dissolved salts and minerals have been removed either by a process known as distillation or de-ionization. Ideally battery water should have a TDS value varying from 0-10 ppm Ideal drinking water should have TDS value between 0-500.  RED BATTERY WATER SOLD IN MARKET IS A FRAUD. Recently after having bought the TDS meter from aliexpress.com, I got the chance to test things after having bought 100 liters of de-ionized water from a reliable supplier based in plot#277, street 1, I-9/3 and a regular bottle of battery water being sold in open market for Rs. 30 per 200ml for sake of testing. To my surprised, the RED battery water sold in market had a TDS value of 615 whereas home tab water had a TDS value of 339 and de-ionized water bought from source mentioned on main thread had the TDS value of 3. In-order to verify things, I further went to 6 different shops and bought the red colored battery water from different sources and non-had a TDS value below 500. You can very well understand that you being ripped in market, made to buy water which is not even near fit for its intended use. TDS VALUES OF DE-IONIZED WATER (BATTERY WATER) AVAILABLE IN MARKET FROM DIFFERENT MANUFACTURER: Volta battery water?s TDS value turned out to be 466 ppm posted on message no 2259, page 113 on this thread with pictures and compared with Nestle water with TDS value of 176. 2. Guard battery water?s TDS value turned out to be 345 ppm posted on message no 2272, page 114 on this thread with pictures and compared with my Home Tab water with TDS value of 195. Aone Spark battery water TDS value turned out to be 741 ppm posted on message no 2304, page 116 on this thread with pictures and compared with my Home Tab water with TDS value of 217 this time as expected as this is a running water. So clearly Aone Spark battery water is also not fit for batteries. AGS Battery Tonic TDS value turned out to be 005 ppm posted on message no 2327, page 117 on this thread with pictures by @ Me4726. I am glad to see, least AGS is not cheating on her buyers. Later, I also got a chance to perform test on AGS tonic bought from another shop and TDS value turned out to be 004 ppm, consistent with earlier reading taken by a member. Valley Ultra Distilled water, contact no: 051-4430067, 051-4101005, email address: nfsvalley@hotmail.com TDS results turned out to be 004 ppm posted on message no: 2322, page 117 with results posted by @asjdsm. I also have taken the TDS reading and picture can also be seen in last image of main body of thread in a cup with a TDS meter inserted. Battery water being sold under the name of “BATTERY TONIC with AGS battery’s picture on it” has TDS value turned out to be 339 ppm posted on message no 2875, page 144 on this thread with picture. TDS value of De-ionized water from Pryo Chemicals turned out to be 32ppm, test was done on a single sample of De-ionized water bottle bought from a PSO pump in DHA Lahore. I will keep on adding the results here, few brothers have ordered the TDS meter online and they would be able to re-verify the readings later. Anyway, above is a disturbing trend, since most of us don?t have a choice so I would advise you to prefer Nestle Drinking water over this crap being sold in market to top up the batteries for time being till we are not able to locate a good supplier.","hash4u;2557091: Doc, without Amp meter, volt meter, not possible to reply back. the Battery guys have a meter for dummies in hand. i think it has resistors in it, which puts loads on the system and the needle states if the batter is good, bad,,,,or in replace point. Talha bhai ty for the rep thats the carbon pile load tester, it has a knob to apply a resistive load on the battery depending on battery size and see when its amp pumping ability drops below 9.8V - (amp pumping ability example is when your starter starts to crank your engine) if your SG was out the window or gone for a trip - it will not survive any load test and would also show a surface charge of 13 to 14V sometimes.. (meaning the mixture holds less water and current transfer is limited - this phenomenon may have also sulphated the battery plates) - anyways SG should be checked and the battery temperature stabilised at 30 degree celcius, then slow charged, left alone for 2 hours then load tested 2 times to confirm its dead or not (only if all the cells passed the SG equality test) Ive built a simple but very dumb battery charger with a light bulb and diode (to convert to DC) to charge a dead battery i have lying around. But the Mrs Department is already finicky with me playing with electricity and acid at the same time.",,
"PERSONAL EXPERIENCE Three years back I got interested in analyzing the procedure which is used by battery maintenance shops. They purchase Sulfuric in drums and then mix it with tap water in 66 % by volume. They say that chemical reaction causes the water to boil which remove the oxygen molecules from the mixture hence results in giving up gravity of 1250 which they pour it in car batteries. Batteries run fine for year or two whereas I think if it is all about removing impurities from car batteries then they are making a mistake by adding tap water which would off course boil the water but would not guarantee the removal of impurities present inside the water. I have six batteries of 200 Amps each in my office which can support 15 computers during heavy load shedding. In order to overcome the Myth, I purchased a drum of Sulfuric Acid and have mixed it with distilled water which I have produced it in my own lab. I took all my batteries outside and have flushed it with tab water to remove all the deposits present inside the batteries. Flush was performed multiple times then batteries were refilled with Acid of 1250-1270 gravity prepared within my office compound. Since, electrolyte was prepared with distilled water and UPS was properly adjusted so even at the end of the third year my batteries are able to provide 90 % backup time as compared to the time of purchase, even after excessive load shedding of 1 hour?s; 5-6 times a day from last three years. Flush is a periodic exercise which is performed at least once a year also I have adjusted the output of my UPS to charge per battery at rate not more than 8 Amps. So basically the right ups settings along with a good electrolyte and distilled water prepared in my own lab used for topping up the batteries later made the difference. That?s is not something difficult as my entire intent is to educate my audience regarding these simple techniques which will give you years of trouble free service. NOTE: ELECTROLYTE GRAVITY IS ADJUSTED ONCE IN START, LATER YOU POUR DE-IONIZED OR DISTILLED WATER FOR TOPPING UP. CHANGE IN S.G LATER IN ANY CELL POINTS TOWARDS A PROBLEM AREA. AT THIS STAGE, YOU NEED TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE EITHER BY LOOKING AT UPS ADJUSTMENT, EITHER IT?S BECAUSE OF BAD ELECTROLYTE OR NEEDS A FLUSH. LESSONS LEARN: 1) If electrolyte is prepared with tab water then batteries will die much earlier than its actual life. 2) Wrong UPS settings is yet another major factor which contributes in killing your batteries much earlier. 3) With wrong combinations of both, you will start to experience problems with batteries within first three months. Having understood the issue, My two 220 AMP-HR batteries connected with my UPS at home powers the entire house lighting, fans and runs flawlessly without much reducing the electrolyte and backup time even after two years. HOW TO ADJUST UPS Most of us are using the similar local UPS sold in market. The only problem with these UPS is that they have few parameters which most of the times are not adjusted properly. Now once you buy these UPS then try to get it adjusted at shop before bringing it to your home. By rule of thumb the maximum allowable charging rate of Lead Acid batteries are its Amp Hour rating divided by 10. For 145 AH battery; the correct charging rate is 145 AH/10 is 14.5 Volts. Anything above this would be termed as fast charging which would damage your batteries in long run. Slow charging is good for batteries but if intensity of load shedding is frequent then probably batteries won?t be prepared before it enters next cycle of load shedding. So you need to look into your circumstances before adjusting this figure but in circumstances you should go above maximum allowable charging rate. You should always ask local UPS shops to adjust these parameters according to specification given below. If you are interested in learning them then ask him to do it in front of you. Mark those parameters with paper tape so that you don?t forget once you do it yourself. Also try to work these settings in your mind first so that you may directly dictate the electrician. These UPS have a PCB card which has many variables. These variables can be adjusted using a screw driver. During load shedding the Output of the UPS is much more than normal Voltage. Adjust the variables such that your Output Voltage should never exceed 265 Volts once batteries are fully charged and put into backup mode. Adjust such that once output voltage reaches 220 Volts then your UPS should trigger the alarm and should shutdown within 10 seconds. Adjust the charging rate of each battery such that (AMP HOUR rating divided by 10). E.g For 200 AMP-HR batteries, I can keep it somewhere closer to 15 Amperes but will never exceed 20 amperes. Slow charging is very good for batteries but look into your circumstances as batteries will take more time to charge its self and you need to the batteries to be prepared for next cycle of load shedding. UPS should stop charging your batteries once the output voltage two batteries connected in series reaches 28 Volts and for single battery UPS system, it reaches 14 Volts. This is termed as cutoff Voltage. During Load shedding, once output of batteries (where two batteries are connected in Series) reaches 21 Volts then Alarm should trigger and UPS must be shut down immediately. Also note the output of UPS at that instance as it should not be less than 220 Volts otherwise sensitive electronic equipments such as TV?s, computers and routers will start to restart its self. Always keep your UPS line separate from main line. Your UPS should shutdown immediately if load exceeds the maximum capacity. UPS shops have different bulbs installed on board with different Powers to adjust these settings on UPS system. Always test under full load so that you are aware about the maximum load your UPS can take. Now, your computers should be safe under these configurations. You will need a good quality Voltmeter and AMP meter. Since chemical properties of battery?s changes the entire year so you will have to check your tuning after every few months which you can easily do with help of a Voltmeter, Amp-meter & hydrometer. PREPARING ELECTROLYTE: I don?t recommend that you prepare the electrolyte at home as mixing sulfuric acid with distilled water produces a lot of heat which can severely hurt any individual. If you can buy the electrolyte of 1250 gravity from some company like PRYO chemicals then that?s a best possible scenario. Otherwise, follow below. HOW TO PRODUCE DISTILLED WATER It is very easy to produce distilled water at home. By distilled water we simply refer to the water which is heated then it changes its form into steam. Steam should be allowed to pass through some system where it can condense so that it may change its form back into liquid and this liquid can be collected in some separate container. This liquid will be free from all sorts of impurities and is called distilled water. I have used a pressure cooker, air conditioning coils, rubber pipes, two plastic containers one for dipping the coils into cold water so that steam inside the coil can change its form back into liquid and other end connected to rubber pipe so that now distilled water can be collected into a second plastic container. HOW TO MIX ACID WITH DISTILLED WATER Specific gravity is measured in (kg/cu.m) for your reference as I won?t be repeating these symbols during this topic afterwards. Water has a specific gravity of 1000 where as Sulphuric acid has specific gravity of 1800. Once you mix 66% (in volume) of distilled water in 34% (in volume) Sulphuric Acid then you should get a gravity of 1240. But normally you end up getting a gravity of 1400 as lot of distilled water is evaporated during this process due to heat being generated. You can make later adjustments using distilled water once Acid has cooled down as at that time no heat will be generated. Always remember that battery will show increased gravity once charged and reduced gravity once discharged. Initially aim for gravity of 1250 and then you can take the reading after a week and make fine adjustments by using electrolyte prepared earlier of 1400 gravity or 1350. Always pour Acid on distilled Water not distilled water on Acid. Wear Rough Clothes, Glasses and gloves if possible. Keep the Acid and Mixture out from the reach of Children. Lot of heat would be generated during this process so be very careful. Always Use plastic Container not Metal. Mixture will take minimum 24 hours to cool down. Never pour the mixture inside the battery once it?s hot. 64 % distilled water should be Mixed with 36 % Acid by Volume. You may end up getting a gravity of 1400. Keep hydrometer with you and only check once fluid has cooled down. You can perform later adjustments by pouring more distilled water on the mixture once it has cooled down and at that time no heat will be generated. Use Plastic bottles to store the mixture. Always Label it as ?Very Dangerous Sulphuric Acid with Gravity ABC ?. Keep it in safe place where no one other then you can touch it. Container used for producing the mixture should never again be used for taking bath. Don?t allow anyone to misuse the Acid for hurting anyone. HOW TO PERFORM FLUSH Procedure which I follow is that I fully charge my batteries, then take the batteries outside, drained the electrolyte in proper sewerage line while I already have an access to new electrolyte which was prepared earlier before performing this procedure and have the batteries flushed it with tap water 5-6 times. Later put the battery in upside down position for 30 minutes before pouring new electrolyte back in. DIAGNOSING ISSUES WITH UPS SYSTEM (BATTERIES AND UPS) KNOW YOUR SITUATION: Electricity outrage in Pakistan varies, sometimes after every 6 hours in few places and sometime after every hour for next three hours. UPS might be perfectly tuned but may fail to cope up with changing situation. Charging rate which may be properly set up for winter season or for few areas may not be able to cope up with high demand once electricity outrage will be more frequent. Under these scenario, first your ups may not be able to give desired performance and secondly your batteries may be exposed to damage which may result from remaining discharge for an extended period. It is very important that two variables must be properly adjusted on UPS, the first one is low cut off voltages and second one is the charging rate which may require adjustments as per the situation as highlighted above. LOW CUT OFF VOLTAGE: This variable is set to 10.3Volts and UPS should trip once voltage on battery terminals reaches this voltage. As extended discharging will surely damage the batteries very soon once voltage on battery terminal will drop below 10.3Volts. CHARGING RATE: this much be adjusted in accordance to your situation, you should know the maximum allowable charging rate, slow charging is good for batteries but once electric outrage is more frequent and for long duration then you should try to increase the charging rate till ups is able to charge the batteries within hour or two. For example, If you have two batteries of pheonix UGS 215, whereas the company?s wesite site says that its AMP-HR rating is 160AMP-HR and charging rate is set to 7Amperes then use the formula of maximum allowable charging rate AMP-HR/10 which in this case comes out to be: 160/10=16, try to increase the charging rate till 10 Amperes or 14 Amp but never exceed 16 Amperes. Then try to observe if next time UPS charges the battery in needed time or not and correspondingly you can make the fine adjustments. Charging rate is set by attaching the AMP meter on battery wire, then slightly turning the charging rate variable on PCB board while ups is still charging the batteries. Either it?s going to increase or decrease which you can easily see on amp meter. TWO MOST IMPORTANT VARIABLES: CHARGING RATE AND CUT OFF VOLTAGE People who says that their batteries dies within 3 to 6 months or they start to experience low backup time very soon then they should cross verify the cut off voltage at which charging stops and the charging rate. If your these two variables are set properly then your battery will not give you unexpected surprises and plus it has a good electrolyte then trust me, it will easily go above 2.5 years provided battery does not have any manufacturing fault. THINGS WHICH ONE SHOULD CONSIDER BEFORE BUYING A UPS SYSTEM AND SELECTING BATTERIES FOR IT. Imported ups will definitely will save you from many problems, as you won?t have to worry about cut off voltage at which charging stops, low cut off voltage at which ups should trip, load setting which indicates the maximum load which ups can take, output voltages if you want to run your TV or computers on ups but still people do make a mistake even once buying the imported UPS system. Which is that they don?t consider reading the maximum charging rate at which ups starts to charge the batteries and they correspondingly don?t select the correct battery. Most of the imported ups system starts to charge the batteries at 10-12 Volts which implies that you should never buy a battery whose AMP-HR rating is below 150 least. Charging rate on imported UPS are fixed and can?t be manually adjusted. Good thing is that it charges the battery at three different charging rates which corresponds to the voltages on battery terminals which is a desirable thing. IF YOU WANT TO RUN YOUR TV?S AND COMPUTERS ON UPS SYSTEMS: IMPORTED UPS Even if batteries are not in good health, imported ups will maintain the output voltage to 220 and would trip once batteries will discharge to a limit as set by factory. So we have no problem here. LOCAL UPS: But with local UPS systems, output voltage will drop once batteries are going to discharge. You should not set the output voltage of local ups to 220 volts once batteries are fully charged as by time once batteries will be completely discharge with voltage on battery terminal to be around 10.3 Volts then maybe your output voltage will drop to 160 to 180 Volts. That?s why it is important that output voltage maybe set to 250 or 255 volts so by the time once voltage on battery terminals should reach 10.3 Volts then output voltage may still be above 220 Volts. Otherwise, you will keep on experiencing burnt WIFI adopters, mobile charging adopters, wifi devices and TV?S. Output voltage on ups is adjusted by fully charging the batteries and removing every device off from its output just in-order to be safe. Then you need to insert the voltmeter in its output and adjust the output voltage to a desired value using the onboard variable. SOLAR INVERTERS, ON-GRID, OFF-GRID, BATTERIES COMPATIBILITY WITH INVERTER AND SOLAR PANELS   Not all solar inverters are compatible with solar panels or for matter of fact goes well with any sort of batteries may it be dry or lead acid batteries. Things will work, but will eventually ruin your battery bank very quickly for reasons discussed in thread below. It is very important that one carefully selects the inverter which is able to provide the correct voltage needed to charge the batteries. Things such as inverter allows you to wire few solar panels in series, your load, inverter type, how different systems are integrated with each other at battery level, what should be your total panels output needed to charge the batteries and simultaneously power the attached load such that it does not kills your battery bank or leave it uncharged is discussed and how could your replace your ups with hybrid solar inverter which means saving in terms of electricity bills due to UPS. I be happy to extend my experience and knowledge on subject matter either on thread below or on same thread. 13https://www.pakwheels.com/forums/mechanical-electrical/276598-diy-solar-panel-installation-controller-selection-batteries13 DISTILLED AND DE-IONIZED WATER SUPPLIERS I will start adding the locations and address of agencies which provide distilled and de-ionized water here. Right now one of the members (@stonedsaint) have provided this address and I have verified this by calling them as they are offering de-ionized water at Rs 9/Liter. You should take your bottle along with you otherwise they charge Rs 500 non-refundable for big plastic container.

Comments: Rs 9/Liter seems like a good deal. Pyrochem provides Electrolyte prepared with De-ionized water, those who are based in Lahore can contact them. Delivery Guy, according to one member @deltoid61 says that they may be able to provide in other cities. Pyrochem (Pvt) Limited, 96-Bank Square Market, Model Town, Lahore - Pakistan. Tel: +92-42-35839278 / 35854646, Fax: +92-42-35887366 E-mail: info@pyrochem.com.pk Here is number of delivery Guy 0300-4729119 ASK FOR 4% TO 5% DISCOUNT ON ORIGINAL BATTERY PRICE IF YOU INTEND TO PREPARE YOUR OWN ELECTROLYTE OR BUY IT FROM ANOTHER SOURCE Once you have confirmed the final price on a given battery then ask them for a discount if you intend to prepare the electrolyte yourself or buy It from somewhere else. most battery shops provide the discount happily if you want to use your own electrolyte. I do it all the time once I buy a new battery and @deltoid61 has reported the same on post no: 1298 WRONG FLUSH PROCEDURE AND PRACTICES I really find it hard to replay every one as people are making all sorts of mistake while making the flush and most of them are doing it blindly not knowing if it?s going to be successful or not. kindly judge before doing so and won?t be successful under the condition. You had been using dirty electrolyte right from start and batteries have gone bad or impurities are coated on the cells leaving very little active material behind. Batteries have died because of slow charging rate such that it enters into next cycle of load shedding without being properly charged or cutoff Voltage is badly set such as 27 Volts for double battery system. Or batteries are damaged because of overcharging such that one of the cells are now damaged. Or batteries have outlived its useful life and very less active material is left on the cells. You may perform flush You can still perform flush if you know batteries had the bad electrolyte and still all cells are ok and now you want to replace it with good one. Once charging rate, cutoff voltage is properly setup and you feel in-between that now backup time has started to drop and then do it immediately. MAIN REASON, LIGHT FLUSH IS PERFORMED. As the battery sheds its lead to the bottom of the container, a conductive layer forms, and once the contaminated material fills the allotted space at bottom of the battery and conductive material reaches the plates then creates a shorting effect and sometimes conductive material gets stuck between two plates creating a short and drains the battery fast. This condition only happens on a batteries which properly charges and discharges unlike batteries which never gets a chance to charge properly or die prematurely because of formation of sulfate crystals. Perform flush, once your charging system is properly adjusted right from start and you have noticed that backup time is dropping then immediately perform flush so that you can eliminate above factor by doing so. I have been successful number of times in restoring the backup time as I understand what I am doing. Even then you go ahead and perform flush without being successful then note that above factor was not responsible for reduced backup time. Do it before a damage has occurred as nothing you will do later will bring a bad cell back to its life. SPECIFIC GRAVITY AND PEOPLES CONFUSION Electrolyte specific gravity is an indicator which tells that batteries are good or bad. To make it simple, just like we use voltmeter to measure dc voltage on battery terminals and AC output voltage, we use amp-meter to measure the charging rate on batteries as these values helps us tune our UPS, the same way Electrolyte specific gravity measured with help of hydrometer tells us lot about how good your batteries are. It?s little tricky to draw conclusions out after reading the specific gravity so don?t start getting worried very quickly. So understand it this way, that you cannot answer few question by a single answer, same is the case with S.G reading. You need to consider following before drawing any conclusion. Specific gravity reading should always be taken on a fully charged batteries, as during discharging, sulfuric acid within electrolyte gets absorbed in cells whereas during charging sulfuric acid comes out to mix with the electrolyte within batteries so you will never observe a good value if you will take those readings on a fully discharged batteries, may your batteries have no issues and you may keep on getting worried for nothing. Once, new electrolyte is added in batteries (on new batteries or after flush) with ups properly tuned, then it takes approximately two weeks for batteries to show its true S.G value. This is because, the sulfuric acid content within the electrolyte is heavy and goes down to settle in bottom. Within repeated charging and discharging, it gives ample chance for both the contents in electrolyte which is sulfuric acid and distilled water to mix with each other. If you know, your UPS is properly turned then don?t get immediately worried after adding the electrolyte in batteries. Variation of SPECIFIC GRAVITY between different cells straightaway points towards a problem with one or with more cells. You can jump to the conclusion directly here. Kindly take into account, if I misquoted somewhere that if you need to increase the specific gravity then add electrolyte with higher specific gravity into it. Normally if electrolyte was prepared with right adjustments in start then you don?t need to do this throughout the life span of battery so always add distilled water if level of electrolyte drops later at any stage. Later if you see that all the cells are showing 1250 or 1230 specific gravity except one which is showing 1160 then that?s an indicator that this cell is bad. Adding electrolyte with higher specific gravity will not solve the problem. It?s up-to you, if you want to perform the flush or any other exercise which may recover the cell before it completely goes bad. ISSUE WITH BATTERY REPAIR SHOPS: INSTALLING NEW LEAD PLATES Analyze the issue, every battery designed or manufactured is on certain AMP-HR ratings that is dictated by cells cross section area, thickness and lead plates in every cell. Now if you have a 200 AMP-HR battery which you have given to the repair shop, then how do you expect that to attach the same numbers of plates in every cell that they will use the same cross section area and thickness depending upon the AMP-HR ratings? These repair people are mostly uneducated and they have standard plates which they fit in every battery thus this alters the original AMP-HR ratings. Once a battery which used to be off 200 AMP-HR rating was charged at 15 Amperes of current by UPS has now became maybe of 70 AMP-HR rating and has become unfit to be charged at the same rate. God knows, where they buy the lead plates from and what about its quality s and above all, I once got the job done from them on two of my 200 Amp-hr batteries and lead plates which they fit in were of a very small size as compared to what it came from factory originally. And they charged me RS 4000 for single battery, not worth the time and money to be wasted on it and above all it died within first two months with much reduce backup time. DEEP CYCLE BATTERIES VS ORDINARY STARTER LEAD ACID BATTERIES: Difference between deep cycle batteries and ordinary lead acid batteries are the plate specification, deep cycle batteries have been designed for UPS/INVERTERS, solar panels and to be used with wind turbines, have think plates and can considerably discharge to a lower limit such as 50% of the batteries capacity where as ordinary lead acid batteries can only be discharged to 80% then they would require charging again, have thin plates with large surface area and very good for cranking vehicles as it can deliver high voltage for a very short duration of time as needed for the application. So there is a tradeoff between cold cranking voltages and backup time. Recently I have seen phoenix batteries in Pakistan producing UGS series specifically designed for UPS/INVERTERS. Although, the site does not clearly labels its as deep cycle batteries but still should be preferred over ordinarily lead acid batteries because of thicker plate size as desired and will surely last for a longer time. I am sure, they will not try to rip people by increasing their price just for heck free publicity they are getting from here. DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 12 VOLT UPS AND 24 VOLT UPS: Many find this confusing, so you can understand this way that lead acid battery manufacturers develop batteries in 12Volt format, so now UPS manufacturer?s designs a system in-order to get connected to 12 Volt battery or two 12 Volts batteries connected in series to make it a 24 Volts system just in-order to double the backup time for those who desire such system. Connecting batteries in series doubles the voltage but AMP-HR rating for the system would remain same. Which just says that formula which is applicable for calculating the maximum allowable charging rate for 12 Volt battery bank will also apply to a 24 Volt battery bank. Let me explain this with example, if you have 160 AMP-HR battery connected with 12Volts system then maximum allowable charging rate for this case is 160/10=16, now if you have two 160AMP-HR batteries connected in series on 24Volt system then again maximum allowable charging rate will again be 16 amperes for this setup, it?s just that now you can run the same load for double the time on 24Volts setup. If novices does not wants to confuse himself, then don?t read further. You must be thinking that I can connect two batteries of same capacity on 12 Volts UPS system in parallel configuration which will also double the backup time. Then answer is that you are right, but here you will have to add up the AMP-HR capacities of both the batteries in-order to calculate the new maximum allowable charging rate and discharging rate. In parallel configuration with two 160 AMP-HR batteries, you can now charge your system at 32 amperes of maximum allowable charging rate as current divides in parallel configuration. So in short, if your 12 volts one battery could have lit maximum 15 of the energy savers for one hours than 24 battery bank can light the same for 2 hours. Now, once you will add two batteries in parallel on 12 Volts system then you can increase the number of bulbs to 30, can either lit those 30 for one hour or turn 15 off to light yet another 15 for two hours. Hope, you must have got it as I could not make it simpler this this. P.S: in above example, I have ignored the limitations imposed by UPS on a battery bank, like few have safety switches, which will go off if you will try to light 30 energy savers for 1 hour on 12 Volts system with two batteries in parallel. WHAT DOES 700W, 1000W AND 3000W UPS MEAN: I don?t think, that local ups manufacturer or local shops who prepare the transformers or individual parts understands what it really means by term 700W. But in case of imported UPS, we surely do know. LIMITS IMPOSED ON UPS BY MANUFACTURER The word 700W says that (P=VI, 700=220*I, I=3.181 Amperes) at any moment, if you will exceed the load by 3.181 ac amperes, the UPS will not handle it and has a safety switch which will go off or UPS will shut down without giving you a warning. Purpose of this limit is that beyond 3.181amperes of current, you ups equipment can get damaged so safety switch will go off, but there are limits on batteries as well and we want the ups to shut down if that is also being abused as otherwise we may experience voltage drop on output lines which will damage the attached electrical systems. MAXIMUM LIMITS OF YOUR BATTERIES Lead Acid batteries its self-have defined specs which clearly quotes amount of maximum current it can handle. Formula says that lead acid batteries should not be discharged at rate AMP-HR rating/6, or AMP-HR rating/4 or in extreme AMP-HR rating/3, below that you will definitely experience abnormal behavior such as dimming of lights, burnt tv?s, adopters, wifi devices. EXAMPLE: Maximum discharging rate: 200/6 turns out to be 66.666 dc amperes. Formula roughly says that you should not go near this limit but if you do, it may handle this for a while, exceeding this will immediately let you have it. Pin=Pout, 12*66.6666=220 *I ac, I ac=3.63 Now, after reading above two readings, you can clearly make out that this UPS will go well with 200 amp-hr batteries and will protect you against an undesirable voltage drop. PURPOSE OF LIMITS: dimming of lights is an undesirable thing on ups especially if you have attached power adopters, TV?s on it. If family member accidently connects an Iron on UPS line, then you would want the entire system to shutdown rather than experiencing a voltage drop as that can burn any delicate electrical instrument attached to your line. RULE OF THUMB: MAXIMUM LOAD LIMIT OF BATTERIES> Load LIMIT IMPOSED on UPS LOCAL UPS: local UPS has a variable on UPS card, through which you can easily make this adjustment. UPS shops has a circuit board on which they have different bulbs of different ratings, by turning on different bulbs of different ratings, they can make this adjustment on ups cards provided if you ask them to do so forcefully. PERSONALLY: if I had to buy a local ups, I would buy a 3000watt ups or maybe 2000watt, considering my 160AMP-HR bank, I would calculate things like this, amp-hr/4, 160/4=40, Pin=Pout, 12*40=220*I ac, I ac=2.181, I would have my ups trip by manually tuning if Ac load exceeds 2.181 amperes. TOTAL DISSOLVED SOLIDS (TDS) IN WATER AND ITS IMPLICATIONS ON BATTERY Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) are the total amount of mobile charged ions. Including minerals, salts, or metals dissolved in given volume of water expressed in units of mg per unit volume of water or also referred as parts per million (ppm) In short, batter water is a normal water from which dissolved salts and minerals have been removed either by a process known as distillation or de-ionization. Ideally battery water should have a TDS value varying from 0-10 ppm Ideal drinking water should have TDS value between 0-500.  RED BATTERY WATER SOLD IN MARKET IS A FRAUD. Recently after having bought the TDS meter from aliexpress.com, I got the chance to test things after having bought 100 liters of de-ionized water from a reliable supplier based in plot#277, street 1, I-9/3 and a regular bottle of battery water being sold in open market for Rs. 30 per 200ml for sake of testing. To my surprised, the RED battery water sold in market had a TDS value of 615 whereas home tab water had a TDS value of 339 and de-ionized water bought from source mentioned on main thread had the TDS value of 3. In-order to verify things, I further went to 6 different shops and bought the red colored battery water from different sources and non-had a TDS value below 500. You can very well understand that you being ripped in market, made to buy water which is not even near fit for its intended use. TDS VALUES OF DE-IONIZED WATER (BATTERY WATER) AVAILABLE IN MARKET FROM DIFFERENT MANUFACTURER: Volta battery water?s TDS value turned out to be 466 ppm posted on message no 2259, page 113 on this thread with pictures and compared with Nestle water with TDS value of 176. 2. Guard battery water?s TDS value turned out to be 345 ppm posted on message no 2272, page 114 on this thread with pictures and compared with my Home Tab water with TDS value of 195. Aone Spark battery water TDS value turned out to be 741 ppm posted on message no 2304, page 116 on this thread with pictures and compared with my Home Tab water with TDS value of 217 this time as expected as this is a running water. So clearly Aone Spark battery water is also not fit for batteries. AGS Battery Tonic TDS value turned out to be 005 ppm posted on message no 2327, page 117 on this thread with pictures by @ Me4726. I am glad to see, least AGS is not cheating on her buyers. Later, I also got a chance to perform test on AGS tonic bought from another shop and TDS value turned out to be 004 ppm, consistent with earlier reading taken by a member. Valley Ultra Distilled water, contact no: 051-4430067, 051-4101005, email address: nfsvalley@hotmail.com TDS results turned out to be 004 ppm posted on message no: 2322, page 117 with results posted by @asjdsm. I also have taken the TDS reading and picture can also be seen in last image of main body of thread in a cup with a TDS meter inserted. Battery water being sold under the name of “BATTERY TONIC with AGS battery’s picture on it” has TDS value turned out to be 339 ppm posted on message no 2875, page 144 on this thread with picture. TDS value of De-ionized water from Pryo Chemicals turned out to be 32ppm, test was done on a single sample of De-ionized water bottle bought from a PSO pump in DHA Lahore. I will keep on adding the results here, few brothers have ordered the TDS meter online and they would be able to re-verify the readings later. Anyway, above is a disturbing trend, since most of us don?t have a choice so I would advise you to prefer Nestle Drinking water over this crap being sold in market to top up the batteries for time being till we are not able to locate a good supplier.","your UPS is not charging the battery properly - the electrolyte is not gassing hence not moving, in effect because acid is heavier its settled low in the battery case - giving you a low SG of the mixture which is available up top the cells fully charged voltage should be checked after the battery has rested at least 1 hr after charging - and surface charge should be removed too - then check the SG for a 145 AH battery your charge amps should be 14 not 8. Ideally your initial SG was perfect for a UPS battery 1.230 but not favourable for an SLI (starting, lights and ignition) car battery which is shocked by the starter everytime you turn the key - the favourable SG for car batteries is 1.270 at room temperature",,
"PERSONAL EXPERIENCE Three years back I got interested in analyzing the procedure which is used by battery maintenance shops. They purchase Sulfuric in drums and then mix it with tap water in 66 % by volume. They say that chemical reaction causes the water to boil which remove the oxygen molecules from the mixture hence results in giving up gravity of 1250 which they pour it in car batteries. Batteries run fine for year or two whereas I think if it is all about removing impurities from car batteries then they are making a mistake by adding tap water which would off course boil the water but would not guarantee the removal of impurities present inside the water. I have six batteries of 200 Amps each in my office which can support 15 computers during heavy load shedding. In order to overcome the Myth, I purchased a drum of Sulfuric Acid and have mixed it with distilled water which I have produced it in my own lab. I took all my batteries outside and have flushed it with tab water to remove all the deposits present inside the batteries. Flush was performed multiple times then batteries were refilled with Acid of 1250-1270 gravity prepared within my office compound. Since, electrolyte was prepared with distilled water and UPS was properly adjusted so even at the end of the third year my batteries are able to provide 90 % backup time as compared to the time of purchase, even after excessive load shedding of 1 hour?s; 5-6 times a day from last three years. Flush is a periodic exercise which is performed at least once a year also I have adjusted the output of my UPS to charge per battery at rate not more than 8 Amps. So basically the right ups settings along with a good electrolyte and distilled water prepared in my own lab used for topping up the batteries later made the difference. That?s is not something difficult as my entire intent is to educate my audience regarding these simple techniques which will give you years of trouble free service. NOTE: ELECTROLYTE GRAVITY IS ADJUSTED ONCE IN START, LATER YOU POUR DE-IONIZED OR DISTILLED WATER FOR TOPPING UP. CHANGE IN S.G LATER IN ANY CELL POINTS TOWARDS A PROBLEM AREA. AT THIS STAGE, YOU NEED TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE EITHER BY LOOKING AT UPS ADJUSTMENT, EITHER IT?S BECAUSE OF BAD ELECTROLYTE OR NEEDS A FLUSH. LESSONS LEARN: 1) If electrolyte is prepared with tab water then batteries will die much earlier than its actual life. 2) Wrong UPS settings is yet another major factor which contributes in killing your batteries much earlier. 3) With wrong combinations of both, you will start to experience problems with batteries within first three months. Having understood the issue, My two 220 AMP-HR batteries connected with my UPS at home powers the entire house lighting, fans and runs flawlessly without much reducing the electrolyte and backup time even after two years. HOW TO ADJUST UPS Most of us are using the similar local UPS sold in market. The only problem with these UPS is that they have few parameters which most of the times are not adjusted properly. Now once you buy these UPS then try to get it adjusted at shop before bringing it to your home. By rule of thumb the maximum allowable charging rate of Lead Acid batteries are its Amp Hour rating divided by 10. For 145 AH battery; the correct charging rate is 145 AH/10 is 14.5 Volts. Anything above this would be termed as fast charging which would damage your batteries in long run. Slow charging is good for batteries but if intensity of load shedding is frequent then probably batteries won?t be prepared before it enters next cycle of load shedding. So you need to look into your circumstances before adjusting this figure but in circumstances you should go above maximum allowable charging rate. You should always ask local UPS shops to adjust these parameters according to specification given below. If you are interested in learning them then ask him to do it in front of you. Mark those parameters with paper tape so that you don?t forget once you do it yourself. Also try to work these settings in your mind first so that you may directly dictate the electrician. These UPS have a PCB card which has many variables. These variables can be adjusted using a screw driver. During load shedding the Output of the UPS is much more than normal Voltage. Adjust the variables such that your Output Voltage should never exceed 265 Volts once batteries are fully charged and put into backup mode. Adjust such that once output voltage reaches 220 Volts then your UPS should trigger the alarm and should shutdown within 10 seconds. Adjust the charging rate of each battery such that (AMP HOUR rating divided by 10). E.g For 200 AMP-HR batteries, I can keep it somewhere closer to 15 Amperes but will never exceed 20 amperes. Slow charging is very good for batteries but look into your circumstances as batteries will take more time to charge its self and you need to the batteries to be prepared for next cycle of load shedding. UPS should stop charging your batteries once the output voltage two batteries connected in series reaches 28 Volts and for single battery UPS system, it reaches 14 Volts. This is termed as cutoff Voltage. During Load shedding, once output of batteries (where two batteries are connected in Series) reaches 21 Volts then Alarm should trigger and UPS must be shut down immediately. Also note the output of UPS at that instance as it should not be less than 220 Volts otherwise sensitive electronic equipments such as TV?s, computers and routers will start to restart its self. Always keep your UPS line separate from main line. Your UPS should shutdown immediately if load exceeds the maximum capacity. UPS shops have different bulbs installed on board with different Powers to adjust these settings on UPS system. Always test under full load so that you are aware about the maximum load your UPS can take. Now, your computers should be safe under these configurations. You will need a good quality Voltmeter and AMP meter. Since chemical properties of battery?s changes the entire year so you will have to check your tuning after every few months which you can easily do with help of a Voltmeter, Amp-meter & hydrometer. PREPARING ELECTROLYTE: I don?t recommend that you prepare the electrolyte at home as mixing sulfuric acid with distilled water produces a lot of heat which can severely hurt any individual. If you can buy the electrolyte of 1250 gravity from some company like PRYO chemicals then that?s a best possible scenario. Otherwise, follow below. HOW TO PRODUCE DISTILLED WATER It is very easy to produce distilled water at home. By distilled water we simply refer to the water which is heated then it changes its form into steam. Steam should be allowed to pass through some system where it can condense so that it may change its form back into liquid and this liquid can be collected in some separate container. This liquid will be free from all sorts of impurities and is called distilled water. I have used a pressure cooker, air conditioning coils, rubber pipes, two plastic containers one for dipping the coils into cold water so that steam inside the coil can change its form back into liquid and other end connected to rubber pipe so that now distilled water can be collected into a second plastic container. HOW TO MIX ACID WITH DISTILLED WATER Specific gravity is measured in (kg/cu.m) for your reference as I won?t be repeating these symbols during this topic afterwards. Water has a specific gravity of 1000 where as Sulphuric acid has specific gravity of 1800. Once you mix 66% (in volume) of distilled water in 34% (in volume) Sulphuric Acid then you should get a gravity of 1240. But normally you end up getting a gravity of 1400 as lot of distilled water is evaporated during this process due to heat being generated. You can make later adjustments using distilled water once Acid has cooled down as at that time no heat will be generated. Always remember that battery will show increased gravity once charged and reduced gravity once discharged. Initially aim for gravity of 1250 and then you can take the reading after a week and make fine adjustments by using electrolyte prepared earlier of 1400 gravity or 1350. Always pour Acid on distilled Water not distilled water on Acid. Wear Rough Clothes, Glasses and gloves if possible. Keep the Acid and Mixture out from the reach of Children. Lot of heat would be generated during this process so be very careful. Always Use plastic Container not Metal. Mixture will take minimum 24 hours to cool down. Never pour the mixture inside the battery once it?s hot. 64 % distilled water should be Mixed with 36 % Acid by Volume. You may end up getting a gravity of 1400. Keep hydrometer with you and only check once fluid has cooled down. You can perform later adjustments by pouring more distilled water on the mixture once it has cooled down and at that time no heat will be generated. Use Plastic bottles to store the mixture. Always Label it as ?Very Dangerous Sulphuric Acid with Gravity ABC ?. Keep it in safe place where no one other then you can touch it. Container used for producing the mixture should never again be used for taking bath. Don?t allow anyone to misuse the Acid for hurting anyone. HOW TO PERFORM FLUSH Procedure which I follow is that I fully charge my batteries, then take the batteries outside, drained the electrolyte in proper sewerage line while I already have an access to new electrolyte which was prepared earlier before performing this procedure and have the batteries flushed it with tap water 5-6 times. Later put the battery in upside down position for 30 minutes before pouring new electrolyte back in. DIAGNOSING ISSUES WITH UPS SYSTEM (BATTERIES AND UPS) KNOW YOUR SITUATION: Electricity outrage in Pakistan varies, sometimes after every 6 hours in few places and sometime after every hour for next three hours. UPS might be perfectly tuned but may fail to cope up with changing situation. Charging rate which may be properly set up for winter season or for few areas may not be able to cope up with high demand once electricity outrage will be more frequent. Under these scenario, first your ups may not be able to give desired performance and secondly your batteries may be exposed to damage which may result from remaining discharge for an extended period. It is very important that two variables must be properly adjusted on UPS, the first one is low cut off voltages and second one is the charging rate which may require adjustments as per the situation as highlighted above. LOW CUT OFF VOLTAGE: This variable is set to 10.3Volts and UPS should trip once voltage on battery terminals reaches this voltage. As extended discharging will surely damage the batteries very soon once voltage on battery terminal will drop below 10.3Volts. CHARGING RATE: this much be adjusted in accordance to your situation, you should know the maximum allowable charging rate, slow charging is good for batteries but once electric outrage is more frequent and for long duration then you should try to increase the charging rate till ups is able to charge the batteries within hour or two. For example, If you have two batteries of pheonix UGS 215, whereas the company?s wesite site says that its AMP-HR rating is 160AMP-HR and charging rate is set to 7Amperes then use the formula of maximum allowable charging rate AMP-HR/10 which in this case comes out to be: 160/10=16, try to increase the charging rate till 10 Amperes or 14 Amp but never exceed 16 Amperes. Then try to observe if next time UPS charges the battery in needed time or not and correspondingly you can make the fine adjustments. Charging rate is set by attaching the AMP meter on battery wire, then slightly turning the charging rate variable on PCB board while ups is still charging the batteries. Either it?s going to increase or decrease which you can easily see on amp meter. TWO MOST IMPORTANT VARIABLES: CHARGING RATE AND CUT OFF VOLTAGE People who says that their batteries dies within 3 to 6 months or they start to experience low backup time very soon then they should cross verify the cut off voltage at which charging stops and the charging rate. If your these two variables are set properly then your battery will not give you unexpected surprises and plus it has a good electrolyte then trust me, it will easily go above 2.5 years provided battery does not have any manufacturing fault. THINGS WHICH ONE SHOULD CONSIDER BEFORE BUYING A UPS SYSTEM AND SELECTING BATTERIES FOR IT. Imported ups will definitely will save you from many problems, as you won?t have to worry about cut off voltage at which charging stops, low cut off voltage at which ups should trip, load setting which indicates the maximum load which ups can take, output voltages if you want to run your TV or computers on ups but still people do make a mistake even once buying the imported UPS system. Which is that they don?t consider reading the maximum charging rate at which ups starts to charge the batteries and they correspondingly don?t select the correct battery. Most of the imported ups system starts to charge the batteries at 10-12 Volts which implies that you should never buy a battery whose AMP-HR rating is below 150 least. Charging rate on imported UPS are fixed and can?t be manually adjusted. Good thing is that it charges the battery at three different charging rates which corresponds to the voltages on battery terminals which is a desirable thing. IF YOU WANT TO RUN YOUR TV?S AND COMPUTERS ON UPS SYSTEMS: IMPORTED UPS Even if batteries are not in good health, imported ups will maintain the output voltage to 220 and would trip once batteries will discharge to a limit as set by factory. So we have no problem here. LOCAL UPS: But with local UPS systems, output voltage will drop once batteries are going to discharge. You should not set the output voltage of local ups to 220 volts once batteries are fully charged as by time once batteries will be completely discharge with voltage on battery terminal to be around 10.3 Volts then maybe your output voltage will drop to 160 to 180 Volts. That?s why it is important that output voltage maybe set to 250 or 255 volts so by the time once voltage on battery terminals should reach 10.3 Volts then output voltage may still be above 220 Volts. Otherwise, you will keep on experiencing burnt WIFI adopters, mobile charging adopters, wifi devices and TV?S. Output voltage on ups is adjusted by fully charging the batteries and removing every device off from its output just in-order to be safe. Then you need to insert the voltmeter in its output and adjust the output voltage to a desired value using the onboard variable. SOLAR INVERTERS, ON-GRID, OFF-GRID, BATTERIES COMPATIBILITY WITH INVERTER AND SOLAR PANELS   Not all solar inverters are compatible with solar panels or for matter of fact goes well with any sort of batteries may it be dry or lead acid batteries. Things will work, but will eventually ruin your battery bank very quickly for reasons discussed in thread below. It is very important that one carefully selects the inverter which is able to provide the correct voltage needed to charge the batteries. Things such as inverter allows you to wire few solar panels in series, your load, inverter type, how different systems are integrated with each other at battery level, what should be your total panels output needed to charge the batteries and simultaneously power the attached load such that it does not kills your battery bank or leave it uncharged is discussed and how could your replace your ups with hybrid solar inverter which means saving in terms of electricity bills due to UPS. I be happy to extend my experience and knowledge on subject matter either on thread below or on same thread. 13https://www.pakwheels.com/forums/mechanical-electrical/276598-diy-solar-panel-installation-controller-selection-batteries13 DISTILLED AND DE-IONIZED WATER SUPPLIERS I will start adding the locations and address of agencies which provide distilled and de-ionized water here. Right now one of the members (@stonedsaint) have provided this address and I have verified this by calling them as they are offering de-ionized water at Rs 9/Liter. You should take your bottle along with you otherwise they charge Rs 500 non-refundable for big plastic container.

Comments: Rs 9/Liter seems like a good deal. Pyrochem provides Electrolyte prepared with De-ionized water, those who are based in Lahore can contact them. Delivery Guy, according to one member @deltoid61 says that they may be able to provide in other cities. Pyrochem (Pvt) Limited, 96-Bank Square Market, Model Town, Lahore - Pakistan. Tel: +92-42-35839278 / 35854646, Fax: +92-42-35887366 E-mail: info@pyrochem.com.pk Here is number of delivery Guy 0300-4729119 ASK FOR 4% TO 5% DISCOUNT ON ORIGINAL BATTERY PRICE IF YOU INTEND TO PREPARE YOUR OWN ELECTROLYTE OR BUY IT FROM ANOTHER SOURCE Once you have confirmed the final price on a given battery then ask them for a discount if you intend to prepare the electrolyte yourself or buy It from somewhere else. most battery shops provide the discount happily if you want to use your own electrolyte. I do it all the time once I buy a new battery and @deltoid61 has reported the same on post no: 1298 WRONG FLUSH PROCEDURE AND PRACTICES I really find it hard to replay every one as people are making all sorts of mistake while making the flush and most of them are doing it blindly not knowing if it?s going to be successful or not. kindly judge before doing so and won?t be successful under the condition. You had been using dirty electrolyte right from start and batteries have gone bad or impurities are coated on the cells leaving very little active material behind. Batteries have died because of slow charging rate such that it enters into next cycle of load shedding without being properly charged or cutoff Voltage is badly set such as 27 Volts for double battery system. Or batteries are damaged because of overcharging such that one of the cells are now damaged. Or batteries have outlived its useful life and very less active material is left on the cells. You may perform flush You can still perform flush if you know batteries had the bad electrolyte and still all cells are ok and now you want to replace it with good one. Once charging rate, cutoff voltage is properly setup and you feel in-between that now backup time has started to drop and then do it immediately. MAIN REASON, LIGHT FLUSH IS PERFORMED. As the battery sheds its lead to the bottom of the container, a conductive layer forms, and once the contaminated material fills the allotted space at bottom of the battery and conductive material reaches the plates then creates a shorting effect and sometimes conductive material gets stuck between two plates creating a short and drains the battery fast. This condition only happens on a batteries which properly charges and discharges unlike batteries which never gets a chance to charge properly or die prematurely because of formation of sulfate crystals. Perform flush, once your charging system is properly adjusted right from start and you have noticed that backup time is dropping then immediately perform flush so that you can eliminate above factor by doing so. I have been successful number of times in restoring the backup time as I understand what I am doing. Even then you go ahead and perform flush without being successful then note that above factor was not responsible for reduced backup time. Do it before a damage has occurred as nothing you will do later will bring a bad cell back to its life. SPECIFIC GRAVITY AND PEOPLES CONFUSION Electrolyte specific gravity is an indicator which tells that batteries are good or bad. To make it simple, just like we use voltmeter to measure dc voltage on battery terminals and AC output voltage, we use amp-meter to measure the charging rate on batteries as these values helps us tune our UPS, the same way Electrolyte specific gravity measured with help of hydrometer tells us lot about how good your batteries are. It?s little tricky to draw conclusions out after reading the specific gravity so don?t start getting worried very quickly. So understand it this way, that you cannot answer few question by a single answer, same is the case with S.G reading. You need to consider following before drawing any conclusion. Specific gravity reading should always be taken on a fully charged batteries, as during discharging, sulfuric acid within electrolyte gets absorbed in cells whereas during charging sulfuric acid comes out to mix with the electrolyte within batteries so you will never observe a good value if you will take those readings on a fully discharged batteries, may your batteries have no issues and you may keep on getting worried for nothing. Once, new electrolyte is added in batteries (on new batteries or after flush) with ups properly tuned, then it takes approximately two weeks for batteries to show its true S.G value. This is because, the sulfuric acid content within the electrolyte is heavy and goes down to settle in bottom. Within repeated charging and discharging, it gives ample chance for both the contents in electrolyte which is sulfuric acid and distilled water to mix with each other. If you know, your UPS is properly turned then don?t get immediately worried after adding the electrolyte in batteries. Variation of SPECIFIC GRAVITY between different cells straightaway points towards a problem with one or with more cells. You can jump to the conclusion directly here. Kindly take into account, if I misquoted somewhere that if you need to increase the specific gravity then add electrolyte with higher specific gravity into it. Normally if electrolyte was prepared with right adjustments in start then you don?t need to do this throughout the life span of battery so always add distilled water if level of electrolyte drops later at any stage. Later if you see that all the cells are showing 1250 or 1230 specific gravity except one which is showing 1160 then that?s an indicator that this cell is bad. Adding electrolyte with higher specific gravity will not solve the problem. It?s up-to you, if you want to perform the flush or any other exercise which may recover the cell before it completely goes bad. ISSUE WITH BATTERY REPAIR SHOPS: INSTALLING NEW LEAD PLATES Analyze the issue, every battery designed or manufactured is on certain AMP-HR ratings that is dictated by cells cross section area, thickness and lead plates in every cell. Now if you have a 200 AMP-HR battery which you have given to the repair shop, then how do you expect that to attach the same numbers of plates in every cell that they will use the same cross section area and thickness depending upon the AMP-HR ratings? These repair people are mostly uneducated and they have standard plates which they fit in every battery thus this alters the original AMP-HR ratings. Once a battery which used to be off 200 AMP-HR rating was charged at 15 Amperes of current by UPS has now became maybe of 70 AMP-HR rating and has become unfit to be charged at the same rate. God knows, where they buy the lead plates from and what about its quality s and above all, I once got the job done from them on two of my 200 Amp-hr batteries and lead plates which they fit in were of a very small size as compared to what it came from factory originally. And they charged me RS 4000 for single battery, not worth the time and money to be wasted on it and above all it died within first two months with much reduce backup time. DEEP CYCLE BATTERIES VS ORDINARY STARTER LEAD ACID BATTERIES: Difference between deep cycle batteries and ordinary lead acid batteries are the plate specification, deep cycle batteries have been designed for UPS/INVERTERS, solar panels and to be used with wind turbines, have think plates and can considerably discharge to a lower limit such as 50% of the batteries capacity where as ordinary lead acid batteries can only be discharged to 80% then they would require charging again, have thin plates with large surface area and very good for cranking vehicles as it can deliver high voltage for a very short duration of time as needed for the application. So there is a tradeoff between cold cranking voltages and backup time. Recently I have seen phoenix batteries in Pakistan producing UGS series specifically designed for UPS/INVERTERS. Although, the site does not clearly labels its as deep cycle batteries but still should be preferred over ordinarily lead acid batteries because of thicker plate size as desired and will surely last for a longer time. I am sure, they will not try to rip people by increasing their price just for heck free publicity they are getting from here. DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 12 VOLT UPS AND 24 VOLT UPS: Many find this confusing, so you can understand this way that lead acid battery manufacturers develop batteries in 12Volt format, so now UPS manufacturer?s designs a system in-order to get connected to 12 Volt battery or two 12 Volts batteries connected in series to make it a 24 Volts system just in-order to double the backup time for those who desire such system. Connecting batteries in series doubles the voltage but AMP-HR rating for the system would remain same. Which just says that formula which is applicable for calculating the maximum allowable charging rate for 12 Volt battery bank will also apply to a 24 Volt battery bank. Let me explain this with example, if you have 160 AMP-HR battery connected with 12Volts system then maximum allowable charging rate for this case is 160/10=16, now if you have two 160AMP-HR batteries connected in series on 24Volt system then again maximum allowable charging rate will again be 16 amperes for this setup, it?s just that now you can run the same load for double the time on 24Volts setup. If novices does not wants to confuse himself, then don?t read further. You must be thinking that I can connect two batteries of same capacity on 12 Volts UPS system in parallel configuration which will also double the backup time. Then answer is that you are right, but here you will have to add up the AMP-HR capacities of both the batteries in-order to calculate the new maximum allowable charging rate and discharging rate. In parallel configuration with two 160 AMP-HR batteries, you can now charge your system at 32 amperes of maximum allowable charging rate as current divides in parallel configuration. So in short, if your 12 volts one battery could have lit maximum 15 of the energy savers for one hours than 24 battery bank can light the same for 2 hours. Now, once you will add two batteries in parallel on 12 Volts system then you can increase the number of bulbs to 30, can either lit those 30 for one hour or turn 15 off to light yet another 15 for two hours. Hope, you must have got it as I could not make it simpler this this. P.S: in above example, I have ignored the limitations imposed by UPS on a battery bank, like few have safety switches, which will go off if you will try to light 30 energy savers for 1 hour on 12 Volts system with two batteries in parallel. WHAT DOES 700W, 1000W AND 3000W UPS MEAN: I don?t think, that local ups manufacturer or local shops who prepare the transformers or individual parts understands what it really means by term 700W. But in case of imported UPS, we surely do know. LIMITS IMPOSED ON UPS BY MANUFACTURER The word 700W says that (P=VI, 700=220*I, I=3.181 Amperes) at any moment, if you will exceed the load by 3.181 ac amperes, the UPS will not handle it and has a safety switch which will go off or UPS will shut down without giving you a warning. Purpose of this limit is that beyond 3.181amperes of current, you ups equipment can get damaged so safety switch will go off, but there are limits on batteries as well and we want the ups to shut down if that is also being abused as otherwise we may experience voltage drop on output lines which will damage the attached electrical systems. MAXIMUM LIMITS OF YOUR BATTERIES Lead Acid batteries its self-have defined specs which clearly quotes amount of maximum current it can handle. Formula says that lead acid batteries should not be discharged at rate AMP-HR rating/6, or AMP-HR rating/4 or in extreme AMP-HR rating/3, below that you will definitely experience abnormal behavior such as dimming of lights, burnt tv?s, adopters, wifi devices. EXAMPLE: Maximum discharging rate: 200/6 turns out to be 66.666 dc amperes. Formula roughly says that you should not go near this limit but if you do, it may handle this for a while, exceeding this will immediately let you have it. Pin=Pout, 12*66.6666=220 *I ac, I ac=3.63 Now, after reading above two readings, you can clearly make out that this UPS will go well with 200 amp-hr batteries and will protect you against an undesirable voltage drop. PURPOSE OF LIMITS: dimming of lights is an undesirable thing on ups especially if you have attached power adopters, TV?s on it. If family member accidently connects an Iron on UPS line, then you would want the entire system to shutdown rather than experiencing a voltage drop as that can burn any delicate electrical instrument attached to your line. RULE OF THUMB: MAXIMUM LOAD LIMIT OF BATTERIES> Load LIMIT IMPOSED on UPS LOCAL UPS: local UPS has a variable on UPS card, through which you can easily make this adjustment. UPS shops has a circuit board on which they have different bulbs of different ratings, by turning on different bulbs of different ratings, they can make this adjustment on ups cards provided if you ask them to do so forcefully. PERSONALLY: if I had to buy a local ups, I would buy a 3000watt ups or maybe 2000watt, considering my 160AMP-HR bank, I would calculate things like this, amp-hr/4, 160/4=40, Pin=Pout, 12*40=220*I ac, I ac=2.181, I would have my ups trip by manually tuning if Ac load exceeds 2.181 amperes. TOTAL DISSOLVED SOLIDS (TDS) IN WATER AND ITS IMPLICATIONS ON BATTERY Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) are the total amount of mobile charged ions. Including minerals, salts, or metals dissolved in given volume of water expressed in units of mg per unit volume of water or also referred as parts per million (ppm) In short, batter water is a normal water from which dissolved salts and minerals have been removed either by a process known as distillation or de-ionization. Ideally battery water should have a TDS value varying from 0-10 ppm Ideal drinking water should have TDS value between 0-500.  RED BATTERY WATER SOLD IN MARKET IS A FRAUD. Recently after having bought the TDS meter from aliexpress.com, I got the chance to test things after having bought 100 liters of de-ionized water from a reliable supplier based in plot#277, street 1, I-9/3 and a regular bottle of battery water being sold in open market for Rs. 30 per 200ml for sake of testing. To my surprised, the RED battery water sold in market had a TDS value of 615 whereas home tab water had a TDS value of 339 and de-ionized water bought from source mentioned on main thread had the TDS value of 3. In-order to verify things, I further went to 6 different shops and bought the red colored battery water from different sources and non-had a TDS value below 500. You can very well understand that you being ripped in market, made to buy water which is not even near fit for its intended use. TDS VALUES OF DE-IONIZED WATER (BATTERY WATER) AVAILABLE IN MARKET FROM DIFFERENT MANUFACTURER: Volta battery water?s TDS value turned out to be 466 ppm posted on message no 2259, page 113 on this thread with pictures and compared with Nestle water with TDS value of 176. 2. Guard battery water?s TDS value turned out to be 345 ppm posted on message no 2272, page 114 on this thread with pictures and compared with my Home Tab water with TDS value of 195. Aone Spark battery water TDS value turned out to be 741 ppm posted on message no 2304, page 116 on this thread with pictures and compared with my Home Tab water with TDS value of 217 this time as expected as this is a running water. So clearly Aone Spark battery water is also not fit for batteries. AGS Battery Tonic TDS value turned out to be 005 ppm posted on message no 2327, page 117 on this thread with pictures by @ Me4726. I am glad to see, least AGS is not cheating on her buyers. Later, I also got a chance to perform test on AGS tonic bought from another shop and TDS value turned out to be 004 ppm, consistent with earlier reading taken by a member. Valley Ultra Distilled water, contact no: 051-4430067, 051-4101005, email address: nfsvalley@hotmail.com TDS results turned out to be 004 ppm posted on message no: 2322, page 117 with results posted by @asjdsm. I also have taken the TDS reading and picture can also be seen in last image of main body of thread in a cup with a TDS meter inserted. Battery water being sold under the name of “BATTERY TONIC with AGS battery’s picture on it” has TDS value turned out to be 339 ppm posted on message no 2875, page 144 on this thread with picture. TDS value of De-ionized water from Pryo Chemicals turned out to be 32ppm, test was done on a single sample of De-ionized water bottle bought from a PSO pump in DHA Lahore. I will keep on adding the results here, few brothers have ordered the TDS meter online and they would be able to re-verify the readings later. Anyway, above is a disturbing trend, since most of us don?t have a choice so I would advise you to prefer Nestle Drinking water over this crap being sold in market to top up the batteries for time being till we are not able to locate a good supplier.","short duration of load - headlamps, carbon pile tester",,
My driver mixed water in coolent in my new honda city Now its getting heat up whats the solution,there must be something else wrong sir. Check for radiator cap seating. mixing coolant with water does not damage any vehicle new or old. However a bad radiator cap may result in leakage raising temperature to exponential levels.,,

Thank you in advance!","You can even put a truck battery, but your alternator will have to work longer. But never put the battery smaller than the stock battery. Regarding battery brand, buy any acid battery but make the solution yourself or better is to buy the battery that is pre-filled with acid from factory aka charged battery. Don't get the battery filled from shops they fill it with contaminated acid and water which reduces the battery life. Regarding dry battery, There is not enough big dry battery, the term dry battery is used by shopkeepers for maintenance free batteries. Regarding Maintenance free batteries, They don't last long, max 2-3 years, I have also shifted from Maintenance free battery to pre-filled factory aka charged battery.",,

With premix you will always end up with less than 50% mixture as the already premixed coolant will mix with water already present in the system. To raise the concentration again you will need to buy another large container of premix and waste the old weaker premix unless you can find the same coolant as concentrate. btw - the ZIC coolant is more expensive than havoline as you only get 1.5 litres of coolant concentrate for Rs 2610/- with buying the ZIC coolant, (water is free/almost free) while with the havoline you only pay Rs 2532/- for 2 litres concentrate coolant (which yields 4 litres) So - in a nutshell, you could have spent Rs 2532/- (plus some clean water) and have 4 litres of ready to use coolant. while you spent Rs 2610/- and only got 3litres of ready use coolant, that too of inferior quality. (seems like shopkeeper made a nice sale (they get paid more by ZIC than by Havoline/Chevron). in short ZIC charging you Rs 2610/- for 3 litres ready mix actually cost you Rs 1740/- per litre concentrate (there is only 1.5 litres concentrate in that bottle)) Havoline is available for Rs 1266/- per litre concentrate.

Older cars also were designed with an airgap in the top of the cooling system and this coupled with the original formulation of OAT coolant caused gelling. however nowadays the formulations have changed for better and OAT coolants can be used in such systems (provided you dont buy NOS items from some guy who sells it from a shack in the woods) - The manufacturing and gasketing materials have also changed for the better. If you have a real old machine and require an IAT due to some oddball reason - I would suggest to buy a Si HOAT like glysantin G05 or G48 - they work great in such system and have a 5 year service life.",,

Similarities are both the engines are tilted.. and my secong question is what the engine weight of 2c and 3sgte?","toqeerahmad: is their any difference between both gears as i heard c & s series have same gears? you most probably have an early 1C gearbox mated to your engine and the tunnel would be hammered in. The problem with mazda 808 is that it was never made for a piston engine, its made for rotary engine and in rotary everything sits very low and is quite small too. The original 1.3 litre piston engine for it also sits a bit forwards to the gearbox can clear the bulkhead properly. So to accomodate fatter transmissions, you need to broach the floorpan.",,

The ""gas setting kardo bhai - aisee ke 1 kilo mein poora Karachi ghoom lein"" wont work. The engine should produce near to the same amount of power it was making on petrol at the same rpm, Hence it wont ""soongh"" gas but rather swill it.The transmission take up and variator movement is pre-fed into the ECU to refer to the running parameters, Fiddling with the input is a sure fire way to burn your cheque book. I drive a CVT here in US and the fluid operating temperature spikes really easily on a climb with full accelerator and 4 passengers, Enough temperature that any conventional autobox with DX3 would start to eat itself away.",,

Ceramic Coating Side-By-Side TEST | What's The Difference? pwuser15813110087: Sir it costs 8mil + it is high end in Pakistan unfortunately. in Pakistan. there are 2 schools of thought 1. Get PPF, I can't see my car getting scratched by bikers etc, at the end of day I will pay for ppf again in case of damage on specific panel and my car will be like brand new, if 2 side doors got 6 feet scratch, replace ppf and you're good to go, no worries regarding color matching or paint job or insurance claim etc 2. Rather than investing on ppf, only insurance, and in same scenario above, 6 feet scratch on 2 doors, claim it and get both doors painted and if there's any difference in shade, accept it, or don't even fix scratch because cars with painted panels generally lose more value, in pak many drive scratched cars daily so that they can claim ""their car has 100% genuine paint and it's non accidented"" now it's up to you, decide accordingly",,

"I just got new Honda Civic RS 2023 black color, alot of people recommending me to get PPF on it, please give advise if its worth it and how effective it really is.","""How much does it cost? 1-2 lakh? It's all just a show. If you have money that you want to spend frivolously, then sure. But you should weigh the pros and cons and make your decision. Self-healing paint protection film (ppf)? Is it worth the extra money to prevent scratches on your paint? Think about it, when you sell a car, does anyone care if the paint is marred? Beads? Just spend the weekend waxing your car, brother. If you're in Lahore, can you go without getting your car dinged and scratched? If yes, then go for it. If not, ask yourself what is the true benefit of this ppf? I had heard about using ppf on high-end cars to protect the paint from road chips, but now they're trying to make us crazy about it for Civic and Sportage. Maybe someone else sees more value in wrapping their car in ppf, but for me, the cost outweighs the benefits. In 2019, I ordered a 12""""x72"""" sheet of 3M Scotchgard Pro Series, cleaned my old Vitz headlights, and covered them with this ppf, and to this day, the sheet hasn't oxidized and the headlights are clear and sharp. It cost me $43, but it was somewhat worth the money for me. But even back then, it was quite expensive, and now it has become even more expensive.""",,

Sure, I'll assist you with performing a compression test, both wet and dry. -  - To carry out a compression test, you will need a compression tester. Here are the steps: -  - 1. Ensure that the engine is off and the ignition key is out. - 2. Locate the spark plugs and remove them using an appropriate spark plug wrench. - 3. Connect the compression tester to the spark plug socket of the first cylinder. Make sure it is securely attached. - 4. Have an assistant fully depress the gas pedal to open the throttle plate. - 5. Crank the engine for a few seconds using the starter motor. Note down the reading on the compression tester gauge. - 6. Repeat this process for each cylinder, noting down the readings. -  - Now, let's move on to the wet compression test: -  - 1. With the engine off, add a small amount of engine oil (about one teaspoon) into the spark plug port of the cylinder being tested. - 2. Repeat steps 3 to 6 of the dry compression test. -  - Keep in mind that the compression readings should be relatively higher in the wet test compared to the dry test. This indicates that the piston rings or valves may be causing low compression, which gets temporarily sealed with the added oil in the wet test. -  - Make sure to consult a professional mechanic if you are not confident or unsure about performing the compression test.",,

"Well, the summer season is here and the car ACs are running once again. What do u think guys that should we remove the hot water heater pipe or it should remain there as it is ?","In case of my Corolla `97, yes i have to get that pipe switched twice every year. else, after summers the heater won't work and a/c will be so so. why, i have no clue. anyone?",,

"Well, the summer season is here and the car ACs are running once again. What do u think guys that should we remove the hot water heater pipe or it should remain there as it is ?","sir g i had a khyber,3yrs ago..i got the ac service for that car once nd still the cooling wasnt enough.i changed the ac wala nd went to another guy nd he told me k the ac cooling is not nice bcuz the hot water is entering this place where it shuldnt b in the summers.i dnt know wats the reason for that. wat he told me was that there air passes around these pipes,in winter,these pipes r hot so it works as heater,nd in summer,if the pipes r hot,the cool air gets a little hot nd the ac isnt effective. nd yes it DID made a huge effect on the cooling of ac.so it is recommended for small cars.",,
"Well, the summer season is here and the car ACs are running once again. What do u think guys that should we remove the hot water heater pipe or it should remain there as it is ?","There is absolutely NO reason to stop coolant from running through the heater core during the summer months; unless you have a leak in the heater core. Also, it can help cooling your engine in an emergency if you have a blockage problem in main radiator. As Cateyez mentioned earlier, removing the pipe does not help increase A/C efficiency and it is quite possible that you may end up damaging the connectors by unnecessarily fiddling with them.",,
"Well, the summer season is here and the car ACs are running once again. What do u think guys that should we remove the hot water heater pipe or it should remain there as it is ?","An answer supported with logic: when you turn hot/cold knob (or lever in some cars) a flap moves and seals the hot air path. Hot air still at times get mixed with your AC's chilling air due to any of the following reason: The flap didn't shut one path completely The foam type insulation on flap has worn off The flap is metallic(though very rare) Now there's a check before you plan to get you heater pipes plugged. When your car engine is slightly warm turn on freash air, turn the cooling knob or lever to coolest and feel the air coming from ducts if you think there is hot air added in it you've got to get the heater pipes plugged...note AC was not turned ON in this experiment. Hope I helped",,

Where should I place the enclosure in the vehicle?","You pay make a custom fit enclosure to fit under the rear seat bench. In that case, people usually go for 8"" subs. You can look up some idea's on the net and depending on which city you are, visit one of the reputed shops so they can prepare the enclosure If a 10"" sub fits down there, you can go for it but 1 or multiple 8"" subs is the way to go usually in trucks",,
"Hello everyone! What is the best solution for installing a subwoofer in a Vigo? I would prefer a 12-inch subwoofer, but I could compromise and go with a 10-inch one as well. Where should I place the enclosure in the vehicle?","An amp will make a night and day difference. A reputed unit ( not a Chinese or android unit ) will make around 20-22 rms each channel. Most component sets start with 40-45 W rms. Simply put, your unit won't have enough juice to run your components with good clean power, meaning you'll be able to hear your music but you'll never hear the actual potential of how good the components sound when they run off an amp",,

Still the car wobbles. so it means equipment is faulty. Yes i also got wheels balanced from toyota in rahim yar khan , he washed the alloys properly , filled them with air properly and then balanced the wheel properly and their machine was also newer. Car was good at even 200kmph. The proper procedure is important for a good balance. You are right in that clean wheels and tire pressure are important. The main issue comes with careful centering of the wheel on the machine. If it is not mounted exactly correctly, the machine will read 0-0 but the car will wobble even if the machine is calibrated properly. Using a backconing method with a correctly sized taper cone or a collet, with a flange plate for the front is far better at accurate centering, but most shops do not use these methods.",,

It should be perfectly aligned with the filling valve. The manufacturers always inserts a small weight opposite of the filling valve. Most of the sheeda tairre waalas just installs the tire on rim without paying any attention to that small patch of paint and the problems starts from day 1 on new tires This is done to keep the customer coming again and again and to rip him off of his hard eard money . It is also done to sale more leaded weight to customer at higher rate . I have seen many famous balancers using weights on outside of alloy rims. Or putting poor quality sticker weights which just go flying in wet weather. Sent from my SM-A710F using Tapatalk The rotational alignment with the red (or yellow) dot is only to reduce the total amount of weight needed to balance an assembly. Sometimes, for proper roadforce balancing, this mark may need to be shifted 90, 180 or 270 degrees to achieve a smooth ride. Further, some tires do not have this mark at all. Clip on weights can be used on alloys, providing they are the correct profile, for example many Japanese rims take the FN contour. Adhesive weights work well, but only if they are applied after cleaning the wheels very well, and applying them with clean hands. If done properly, adhesive weights will stay put permanently.",,

Since you are from Karachi, it would be convenient for you to purchase these components.  -  - For your Nissan Cedric Station wagon, I suggest the following setup: -  - Head Unit: Kenwood KDC BT600u - Amplifier: Kenwood KAC HQR8400 - Rear stage: JVC 6x9 five-way coaxial speakers -  - For the front stage, the Carrozzeria TS-C1710a components would be a suitable choice. However, if you are looking for a subwoofer, I recommend the Pioneer TS W307 D4. It will complement the overall sound system. -  - If you have any other suggestions within your budget, that would also be valuable. You mentioned that you wish to have a beginner SQ (sound quality) setup, considering your limited budget.","You have a good headunit and amplification. Kenwoods usually have a warm signature tone compared to the likes of Sony and Pioneer amplifiers. If you are aiming for a SQ setup (be it a beginner setup), my suggestion would be to ditch these components. Instead, you can easily get yourself some infinity referance or jlb gto components. If you can spend between 30-35k, I'd suggest you get the Helix F62C (their mid tier 2 way components). Haroon Radio in Karachi stocks all three of these components As for the sub, ditch it. The 307 was a great sub back in the day (hell I was running 4 of them for a short period of time) but it's not a sq or even a sql sub. Get a jbl cs1214 or the more similarly matched jbl club 1214 or infinity reference 12 sub. Put them in a 0.75-1 cu-ft sealed enclosure and fill it with polyfill. I'd ditch the rear speakers. SQ setups are usually front stage focused. If you still want your rear fill, run the rear speakers directly from your headunit. The 4 channel amp is good for your front stage components and sub",,

Great for spl setups but nothing near what you'd want for a sq setup Run the rear fill from the pre direct. You want the full potential of the amp to power the front stage and the sub. If you ever want to go multiple amp setup, get a mono and you can run the sub from there I'd suggest you also do the work once and properly. Also look into sound deadening. That's a great way to isolate metal resonance inside the cabin",,

Once, one of our college fellows had a 2004 model Kia Classic, which was in pretty good condition. He received a challenge from my class fellow to race against an 88 Civic stock race. The race started, and the Kia quickly reached its limits, causing its axle to break. However, the Civic continued the race. A 2002 Classic was owned by our family friends, and it was a headache. They bought it brand new, but it had so many issues day by day. Eventually, they sold it for 240K. Now, the axle of the Civic didn't break, unlike the Kia.

I have bought a Cultus recently and found its radiator fan is direct. Now i am wondering wheather to keep it as it is or make it indirect. ? Your openion plz.,"if you run your fan directly all the time, you will affect alternator life fan motor life you will warp the cheap plastic fan blade burn the fan relay and sometimes wiring in less than a year Kill your engine by running dead cold (if you or your mechanic lost the thermostat valve too) heres a test you can do, when going 40 km/h stick your hand out the window and check for air turbulence and how far it shoves your arm backwards - now stop and check the cooling fan air push.. you'll get the idea that you are doing no good running it direct. Most good european cars come equipped with a resistor to reduce maximum radiator fan speed to 90% when running on A/C in hot climates to preserve motor life. If your cooling system is good and clean, and the gauge remains ok, you will not need to fiddle with the fan circuit ever. Even Suzuki IFXs cool themselves easily on automatic fan with a thermostat valve in place",,

"Installing spark plugs Torque is one of the most critical aspects of spark plug installation. Torque directly affects the spark plugs' ability to transfer heat out of the combustion chamber. A spark plug that is under-torqued will not be fully seated on the cylinder head, hence heat transfer will be slowed. This will tend to elevate combustion chamber temperatures to unsafe levels, and pre-ignition and detonation will usually follow. Serious engine damage is not far behind. An over-torqued spark plug can suffer from severe stress to the Metal Shell which in turn can distort the spark plug's inner gas seals or even cause a hairline fracture to the spark plug's insulator...in either case, heat transfer can again be slowed and the above mentioned conditions can occur. The spark plug holes must always be cleaned prior to installation, otherwise you may be torquing against dirt or debris and the spark plug may actually end up under-torqued, even though your torque wrench says otherwise. Of course, you should only install spark plugs in a cool engine, because metal expands when its hot and installation may prove difficult. Gapping Since the gap size has a direct affect on the spark plug's tip temperature and on the voltage necessary to ionize (light) the air/fuel mixture, careful attention is required. While it is a popular misconception that plugs are pre-gapped from the factory, the fact remains that the gap must be adjusted for the vehicle that the spark plug is intended for. Those with modified engines must remember that a modified engine with higher compression or forced induction will typically require a smaller gap settings (to ensure ignitability in these denser air/fuel mixtures). As a rule, the more power you are making, the smaller the gap you will need. A spark plug's voltage requirement is directly proportionate to the gap size. The larger the gap, the more voltage is needed to bridge the gap. Most experienced tuners know that opening gaps up to present a larger spark to the air/fuel mixture maximizes burn efficiency. It is for this reason that most racers add high power ignition systems. The added power allows them to open the gap yet still provide a strong spark. With this mind, many think the larger the gap the better. In fact, some aftermarket ignition systems boast that their systems can tolerate gaps that are extreme. Be wary of such claims. In most cases, the largest gap you can run may still be smaller than you think. Indexing This is for racers only !! Indexing refers to a process whereby auxiliary washers of varying thickness are placed under the spark plug's shoulder so that when the spark plug is tightened, the gap will point in the desired direction. However, without running an engine on a dyno, it is impossible to gauge which type of indexing works best in your engine. While most engines like the spark plug's gap open to the intake valve, there are still other combinations that make more power with the gap pointed toward the exhaust valve. In any case, engines with indexed spark plugs will typically make only a few more horsepower, typically less than 1% of total engine output. For a 500hp engine, you'd be lucky to get 5hp. While there are exceptions, the bottom line is that without a dyno, gauging success will be difficult. Heat Range selection Let's make this really simple: when you need your engine to run a little cooler, run a colder plug. When you need your engine to run a little hotter, run a hotter spark plug. However, FAIRSALE AUTOS strongly cautions people that going to a hotter spark plug can sometimes mask a serious symptom of another problem that can lead to engine damage. Be very careful with heat ranges. Seek professional guidance if you are unsure. With modified engines (those engines that have increased their compression) more heat is a by-product of the added power that normally comes with increased compression. In short, select one heat range colder for every 75-100 hp you add, or when you significantly raise compression. Also remember to retard the timing a little and to increase fuel enrichment and octane. These tips are critical when adding forced induction (turbos, superchargers or nitrous kits), and failure to address ALL of these areas will virtually guarantee engine damage. An engine that has poor oil control can sometimes mask the symptom temporarily by running a slightly hotter spark plug. While this is a ""Band-Aid"" approach, it is one of the only examples of when and why one would select a hotter spark plug. Using ""racing"" spark plugs Be cautious! In reality, most ""racing"" spark plugs are just colder heat ranges of the street versions of the spark plug. They don't provide any more voltage to the spark plug tip! Their internal construction is no different than most standard spark plugs. There are some exceptions, though. Extremely high compression cars or those running exotic fuels will have different spark plug requirements and hence FAIRSALE AUTOS deals in spark plugs that are well-suited for these requirements. They are classified as ""specialized spark plugs for racing applications"". Some are built with precious metal alloy tips for greater durability and the ability to fire in denser or leaner air/fuel mixtures. However, installing the same spark plugs Kenny Bernstein uses in his 300+ mph Top Fuel car (running Nitromethane at a 2:1 air/fuel ratio and over 20:1 dynamic compression) in your basically stock Honda Civic (running 15:1 a/f ratios with roughly 9.5:1 compression) will do nothing for you! In fact, since Kenny's plugs are fully 4 heat ranges colder, they'd foul out in your Honda in just a few minutes. FAIRSALE AUTOS as a fair and ethical parts supplier tries to stay clear of saying that a racing spark plug (or ANY spark plug) will give you large gains in horsepower. While certain spark plugs are better suited to certain applications (and we're happy to counsel you in the right direction) we try to tell people that are looking to ""screw in"" some cheap horsepower that, in most cases, spark plugs are not the answer. To be blunt, when experienced tuners build race motors, they select their spark plugs for different reasons: to remove heat more efficiently, provide sufficient spark to completely light all the air/fuel mixture, to survive the added stresses placed upon a high performance engine's spark plugs, and to achieve optimum piston-to-plug clearance. Some of these ""specialized racing plugs"" are made with precious metal alloy center/ground electrodes or fine wire tips or retracted-nose insulators. Again, these features do not necessarily mean that the spark plug will allow the engine to make more power, but these features are what allow the spark plug to survive in these tortuous conditions. Most racers know screwing in a new set of spark plugs will not magically ""unlock"" hidden horsepower. Using high power ignition systems Many of the more popular aftermarket ignition systems are of the capacitive discharge type. They store voltage, or accumulate it, until a point at which a trigger signal allows release of this more powerful spark. Companies like Mallory, MSD, Crane and Accel, to name a few, offer such systems. They affect spark plugs in that they allow the gaps to be opened up to take advantage of the increased capacity. The theory is that the larger and the more intense the spark you are able to present to the air/fuel mixture, the more likely you will be to burn more fuel, and hence the more power you will make. We encourage the use of such systems, but only on modified or older non-computer controlled vehicles. In reality, computer controlled vehicles do such a good job of lighting off the air/fuel mixture (as evidenced by the ultra-low emissions), added ignition capacity would do little to burn more fuel since the stock configuration is doing such a good job. Older non-computer controlled vehicles or those that have been modified with higher compression or boosted (nitrous, turbo, supercharged) engines can certainly take advantage of a more powerful ignition system. =========================================================","""ahsanonline: Since I am unable to create a new forum thread, I have a question for the experts regarding spark plugs.

This will tend to elevate combustion chamber temperatures to unsafe levels, and pre-ignition and detonation will usually follow. Serious engine damage is not far behind. An over-torqued spark plug can suffer from severe stress to the Metal Shell which in turn can distort the spark plug's inner gas seals or even cause a hairline fracture to the spark plug's insulator...in either case, heat transfer can again be slowed and the above mentioned conditions can occur. The spark plug holes must always be cleaned prior to installation, otherwise you may be torquing against dirt or debris and the spark plug may actually end up under-torqued, even though your torque wrench says otherwise. Of course, you should only install spark plugs in a cool engine, because metal expands when its hot and installation may prove difficult. Gapping Since the gap size has a direct affect on the spark plug's tip temperature and on the voltage necessary to ionize (light) the air/fuel mixture, careful attention is required. While it is a popular misconception that plugs are pre-gapped from the factory, the fact remains that the gap must be adjusted for the vehicle that the spark plug is intended for. Those with modified engines must remember that a modified engine with higher compression or forced induction will typically require a smaller gap settings (to ensure ignitability in these denser air/fuel mixtures). As a rule, the more power you are making, the smaller the gap you will need. A spark plug's voltage requirement is directly proportionate to the gap size. The larger the gap, the more voltage is needed to bridge the gap. Most experienced tuners know that opening gaps up to present a larger spark to the air/fuel mixture maximizes burn efficiency. It is for this reason that most racers add high power ignition systems. The added power allows them to open the gap yet still provide a strong spark. With this mind, many think the larger the gap the better. In fact, some aftermarket ignition systems boast that their systems can tolerate gaps that are extreme. Be wary of such claims. In most cases, the largest gap you can run may still be smaller than you think. Indexing This is for racers only !! Indexing refers to a process whereby auxiliary washers of varying thickness are placed under the spark plug's shoulder so that when the spark plug is tightened, the gap will point in the desired direction. However, without running an engine on a dyno, it is impossible to gauge which type of indexing works best in your engine. While most engines like the spark plug's gap open to the intake valve, there are still other combinations that make more power with the gap pointed toward the exhaust valve. In any case, engines with indexed spark plugs will typically make only a few more horsepower, typically less than 1% of total engine output. For a 500hp engine, you'd be lucky to get 5hp. While there are exceptions, the bottom line is that without a dyno, gauging success will be difficult. Heat Range selection Let's make this really simple: when you need your engine to run a little cooler, run a colder plug. When you need your engine to run a little hotter, run a hotter spark plug. However, FAIRSALE AUTOS strongly cautions people that going to a hotter spark plug can sometimes mask a serious symptom of another problem that can lead to engine damage. Be very careful with heat ranges. Seek professional guidance if you are unsure. With modified engines (those engines that have increased their compression) more heat is a by-product of the added power that normally comes with increased compression. In short, select one heat range colder for every 75-100 hp you add, or when you significantly raise compression. Also remember to retard the timing a little and to increase fuel enrichment and octane. These tips are critical when adding forced induction (turbos, superchargers or nitrous kits), and failure to address ALL of these areas will virtually guarantee engine damage. An engine that has poor oil control can sometimes mask the symptom temporarily by running a slightly hotter spark plug. While this is a ""Band-Aid"" approach, it is one of the only examples of when and why one would select a hotter spark plug. Using ""racing"" spark plugs Be cautious! In reality, most ""racing"" spark plugs are just colder heat ranges of the street versions of the spark plug. They don't provide any more voltage to the spark plug tip! Their internal construction is no different than most standard spark plugs. There are some exceptions, though. Extremely high compression cars or those running exotic fuels will have different spark plug requirements and hence FAIRSALE AUTOS deals in spark plugs that are well-suited for these requirements. They are classified as ""specialized spark plugs for racing applications"". Some are built with precious metal alloy tips for greater durability and the ability to fire in denser or leaner air/fuel mixtures. However, installing the same spark plugs Kenny Bernstein uses in his 300+ mph Top Fuel car (running Nitromethane at a 2:1 air/fuel ratio and over 20:1 dynamic compression) in your basically stock Honda Civic (running 15:1 a/f ratios with roughly 9.5:1 compression) will do nothing for you! In fact, since Kenny's plugs are fully 4 heat ranges colder, they'd foul out in your Honda in just a few minutes. FAIRSALE AUTOS as a fair and ethical parts supplier tries to stay clear of saying that a racing spark plug (or ANY spark plug) will give you large gains in horsepower. While certain spark plugs are better suited to certain applications (and we're happy to counsel you in the right direction) we try to tell people that are looking to ""screw in"" some cheap horsepower that, in most cases, spark plugs are not the answer. To be blunt, when experienced tuners build race motors, they select their spark plugs for different reasons: to remove heat more efficiently, provide sufficient spark to completely light all the air/fuel mixture, to survive the added stresses placed upon a high performance engine's spark plugs, and to achieve optimum piston-to-plug clearance. Some of these ""specialized racing plugs"" are made with precious metal alloy center/ground electrodes or fine wire tips or retracted-nose insulators. Again, these features do not necessarily mean that the spark plug will allow the engine to make more power, but these features are what allow the spark plug to survive in these tortuous conditions. Most racers know screwing in a new set of spark plugs will not magically ""unlock"" hidden horsepower. Using high power ignition systems Many of the more popular aftermarket ignition systems are of the capacitive discharge type. They store voltage, or accumulate it, until a point at which a trigger signal allows release of this more powerful spark. Companies like Mallory, MSD, Crane and Accel, to name a few, offer such systems. They affect spark plugs in that they allow the gaps to be opened up to take advantage of the increased capacity. The theory is that the larger and the more intense the spark you are able to present to the air/fuel mixture, the more likely you will be to burn more fuel, and hence the more power you will make. We encourage the use of such systems, but only on modified or older non-computer controlled vehicles. In reality, computer controlled vehicles do such a good job of lighting off the air/fuel mixture (as evidenced by the ultra-low emissions), added ignition capacity would do little to burn more fuel since the stock configuration is doing such a good job. Older non-computer controlled vehicles or those that have been modified with higher compression or boosted (nitrous, turbo, supercharged) engines can certainly take advantage of a more powerful ignition system. =========================================================","Usmanashraf1: Can you please recommend spark plugs for a VTI Prosmatec CNG?

With modified engines (those engines that have increased their compression) more heat is a by-product of the added power that normally comes with increased compression. In short, select one heat range colder for every 75-100 hp you add, or when you significantly raise compression. Also remember to retard the timing a little and to increase fuel enrichment and octane. These tips are critical when adding forced induction (turbos, superchargers or nitrous kits), and failure to address ALL of these areas will virtually guarantee engine damage. An engine that has poor oil control can sometimes mask the symptom temporarily by running a slightly hotter spark plug. While this is a ""Band-Aid"" approach, it is one of the only examples of when and why one would select a hotter spark plug. Using ""racing"" spark plugs Be cautious! In reality, most ""racing"" spark plugs are just colder heat ranges of the street versions of the spark plug. They don't provide any more voltage to the spark plug tip! Their internal construction is no different than most standard spark plugs. There are some exceptions, though. Extremely high compression cars or those running exotic fuels will have different spark plug requirements and hence FAIRSALE AUTOS deals in spark plugs that are well-suited for these requirements. They are classified as ""specialized spark plugs for racing applications"". Some are built with precious metal alloy tips for greater durability and the ability to fire in denser or leaner air/fuel mixtures. However, installing the same spark plugs Kenny Bernstein uses in his 300+ mph Top Fuel car (running Nitromethane at a 2:1 air/fuel ratio and over 20:1 dynamic compression) in your basically stock Honda Civic (running 15:1 a/f ratios with roughly 9.5:1 compression) will do nothing for you! In fact, since Kenny's plugs are fully 4 heat ranges colder, they'd foul out in your Honda in just a few minutes. FAIRSALE AUTOS as a fair and ethical parts supplier tries to stay clear of saying that a racing spark plug (or ANY spark plug) will give you large gains in horsepower. While certain spark plugs are better suited to certain applications (and we're happy to counsel you in the right direction) we try to tell people that are looking to ""screw in"" some cheap horsepower that, in most cases, spark plugs are not the answer. To be blunt, when experienced tuners build race motors, they select their spark plugs for different reasons: to remove heat more efficiently, provide sufficient spark to completely light all the air/fuel mixture, to survive the added stresses placed upon a high performance engine's spark plugs, and to achieve optimum piston-to-plug clearance. Some of these ""specialized racing plugs"" are made with precious metal alloy center/ground electrodes or fine wire tips or retracted-nose insulators. Again, these features do not necessarily mean that the spark plug will allow the engine to make more power, but these features are what allow the spark plug to survive in these tortuous conditions. Most racers know screwing in a new set of spark plugs will not magically ""unlock"" hidden horsepower. Using high power ignition systems Many of the more popular aftermarket ignition systems are of the capacitive discharge type. They store voltage, or accumulate it, until a point at which a trigger signal allows release of this more powerful spark. Companies like Mallory, MSD, Crane and Accel, to name a few, offer such systems. They affect spark plugs in that they allow the gaps to be opened up to take advantage of the increased capacity. The theory is that the larger and the more intense the spark you are able to present to the air/fuel mixture, the more likely you will be to burn more fuel, and hence the more power you will make. We encourage the use of such systems, but only on modified or older non-computer controlled vehicles. In reality, computer controlled vehicles do such a good job of lighting off the air/fuel mixture (as evidenced by the ultra-low emissions), added ignition capacity would do little to burn more fuel since the stock configuration is doing such a good job. Older non-computer controlled vehicles or those that have been modified with higher compression or boosted (nitrous, turbo, supercharged) engines can certainly take advantage of a more powerful ignition system. =========================================================",That's great.

"Installing spark plugs Torque is one of the most critical aspects of spark plug installation. Torque directly affects the spark plugs' ability to transfer heat out of the combustion chamber. A spark plug that is under-torqued will not be fully seated on the cylinder head, hence heat transfer will be slowed. This will tend to elevate combustion chamber temperatures to unsafe levels, and pre-ignition and detonation will usually follow. Serious engine damage is not far behind. An over-torqued spark plug can suffer from severe stress to the Metal Shell which in turn can distort the spark plug's inner gas seals or even cause a hairline fracture to the spark plug's insulator...in either case, heat transfer can again be slowed and the above mentioned conditions can occur. The spark plug holes must always be cleaned prior to installation, otherwise you may be torquing against dirt or debris and the spark plug may actually end up under-torqued, even though your torque wrench says otherwise. Of course, you should only install spark plugs in a cool engine, because metal expands when its hot and installation may prove difficult. Gapping Since the gap size has a direct affect on the spark plug's tip temperature and on the voltage necessary to ionize (light) the air/fuel mixture, careful attention is required. While it is a popular misconception that plugs are pre-gapped from the factory, the fact remains that the gap must be adjusted for the vehicle that the spark plug is intended for. Those with modified engines must remember that a modified engine with higher compression or forced induction will typically require a smaller gap settings (to ensure ignitability in these denser air/fuel mixtures). As a rule, the more power you are making, the smaller the gap you will need. A spark plug's voltage requirement is directly proportionate to the gap size. The larger the gap, the more voltage is needed to bridge the gap. Most experienced tuners know that opening gaps up to present a larger spark to the air/fuel mixture maximizes burn efficiency. It is for this reason that most racers add high power ignition systems. The added power allows them to open the gap yet still provide a strong spark. With this mind, many think the larger the gap the better. In fact, some aftermarket ignition systems boast that their systems can tolerate gaps that are extreme. Be wary of such claims. In most cases, the largest gap you can run may still be smaller than you think. Indexing This is for racers only !! Indexing refers to a process whereby auxiliary washers of varying thickness are placed under the spark plug's shoulder so that when the spark plug is tightened, the gap will point in the desired direction. However, without running an engine on a dyno, it is impossible to gauge which type of indexing works best in your engine. While most engines like the spark plug's gap open to the intake valve, there are still other combinations that make more power with the gap pointed toward the exhaust valve. In any case, engines with indexed spark plugs will typically make only a few more horsepower, typically less than 1% of total engine output. For a 500hp engine, you'd be lucky to get 5hp. While there are exceptions, the bottom line is that without a dyno, gauging success will be difficult. Heat Range selection Let's make this really simple: when you need your engine to run a little cooler, run a colder plug. When you need your engine to run a little hotter, run a hotter spark plug. However, FAIRSALE AUTOS strongly cautions people that going to a hotter spark plug can sometimes mask a serious symptom of another problem that can lead to engine damage. Be very careful with heat ranges. Seek professional guidance if you are unsure.

"Hello everyone,hope y'all r doing good...I want to install sound system in my mehran and needed your help/opinion in a few things. The setup includes:- 2x Sony Xplod XS-N6940 4 way speakers(85rms/500w peak) 1 Pioneer TS-W308D2 Dual coil Subwoofer. 1 Sony XS-NW1200 1800w(300rms) Subwoofer. 2x Sony XS-FB103E 4'' speakers already installed in front doors. Planning to install component speakers as well in front.(not purchased yet) 2x 4 channel Amplifiers(One is JEC 800wRMS 2ohm stable and other is some chinese 4 channel amp my bro bought for around 7k couple of years ago) Headunit will also be upgraded to a good pioneer HU.(not purchased yet) NOW THE PROBLEM IS,I got this car recently and everything is stock(battery/alternator/wiring).I am a student with very limited budget left after spending all my savings on the above mentioned things,Please tell me what do I need to upgrade/change in order to run the sound system smoothly without the risk of killing or underpowering the amps due to low power...As I am quite new to all this and dont know much about alternators or battery(Only read a few forums about the BIG 3 upgrade and all),Please guide me if you have done any of this or have any experience regarding this...Also if I need to change alternator,what can be the estimated price for an alternator that fits in my mehran(euro 2).Also wiring experts,kindly guide me which guage wires would I need for the BIG 3 and the amps. Looking forward...Thanks","So your aim is to go loud I assume since you want 2 12"" subs? First up, don't mix and match. Either get the same 2 12"" subs or go big with 1 15"" sub. You are better of with 1 box for the 2 subs. Different subwoofers in different sized box's is just not the right way. You should also invest in a good ( min 4 AWG ) ofc wire for the big 3. Shops that have the wire also have the ring terminals for them. The hard thing to find is the inline fuse which usually is a part of the kit. I think Sound Valley in pindi saddar had some kit's. Pretty sure Hamza will have them too in Lahore. You have to mention what city you live in The alternator upgrade will need to be done. I'm sure even Big3 or Big4 won't help a Mehran's electronics",,

Looking forward...Thanks","That's a lot of stuff you have. Was the aim to go loud (spl)? Different products, different characteristics, different sounds isn't really a great way to set up a setup. Regardless, I'd suggest you up your wiring. Is it 0/4 or 8 gauge? Do a big3 and add some inline fuses. Are you power/gnd wires ofc or cca? Even if you upgrade your alternator or add another battery, a mehrans wiring can only take so much beating. For a setup of this caliber, you would need atleast true 4 gauge ofc wiring. Do the big3 with 1/0 gauge and if it's in your budget, run 1/0 gauge or 4 gauge to your amps. Make sure the pwr and gnd wires are the same size. Get the wiring upgrade done, then figure out your next upgrade",,

But like you said, a big3 is a must and the amplifier wiring too. SQ setups won't pull that much current since it's more about the listening experience and that can be achieved with very little power compared to an spl setup as the member above has. I can only imagine why his amps keep clipping",,

The stock wiring in the engine bay ( alternator + battery ) is pretty thin. So despite the fact that you install a bigger battery/alternator, the stock wires won't be able to cope with the demanded current flow. Youtube what a Big3 is and get that done before anything else. What city are you living in btw? The inline fuse is only there for protection. It wont solve the problem of your current flow",,

Get something above 80 Amperes! (Mehran generator is around 45 to 50 Ampere = (50 Amps x 13 Volts x 0.6 Class AB efficiency) = 390 Watt RMS) For 2 Subwoofers you need at-least 100 Ampere generator... Your amplifier does not produce power, it just converts power from car into sound... It needs power which your Mehran generator can not produce! This results in lights dimming, battery damage and low output sound!",,
"Aoa Guys, I am going to try and install JL Audio C1-650 components in our City 2004. I am a complete beginner and this might take some time. Nonetheless I am going to make the attempt. I am new to this and this will be my first install hopefully. I would like some guidance here to help me through the process. For now I just have the components. Current Equipment: - JL C1-650 - Some stock pioneer two din pre Need some input on speaker rings. Where to get them from. Any recommendations? I am looking at some 3M rings from daraz. I might need to upgrade the pre, any suggestions on what to pair it with? I would like to install a screen, I am okay with Chinese aftermarket products provided they are okay for my components, otherwise will save up to get something better. So please suggest what should I look at. Thanks","Hay Qurban, are you living in islamabad/rawalpindi? Might I suggest you check out a few build threads here on pakwheels to get an idea The C1 are good components. It would be best to give them proper power through an external amp. A branded headunit will provide more clean power to the components than a Chinese android unit ( stay away from that ) The speaker rings are a great feature to isolate the speakers from the door. But combine that with some sound deadening on the door to really get the best out of them. An external amp will provide more clean power and you'll love the way your components play You can check my Sunny/alto builds. There are other great sq sql builds by the likes of yawar, stj, docshaggy etc Just a heads up, I also have a pioneer6 avh-x5550bt double din headunit for sale along with some sq amps and more goodies",,

I had the same rings initially in my Nissan build and only switched to the stinger kit cuz it was a 3 layer setup. The 3m backing adhesive is really good on these. Just make sure when you are sticking the outer ring, place it around the speaker edge and not over the speaker itself. This way, the speaker is serviceable The x5550bt has been researved by another member now. If the sale doesn't go through, you may buy it. The asking price was 35k. I also had the rainbow ipaul amps for sale, great sq amps but they are a bit pricey. Please check my sale thread. All info is available And lastly, since you are in islamabad, I'd suggest you get in touch with Shehryar @ soundvalley in pindi saddar. He has some good equipment and can arrange also some good branded wiring. You may also ask haroon radio in karachi",,

Dear friends I just got bought new facelift corolla and the driver side door got dented. I got it repainted(my mistake) from 3s dealer two times and still there is mismatch. What should I do,Even if u install a new door from another corolla which is factory painted the paint won't match. You can check with insurance companies who might have totalled cars with brand new doors in silver color. And replace your door. But a slight difference would still be there. OEM paint is baked on the metal door for that finish first of all you need a fresh door and then matched color. For a door already painted you are respraying which means thickness increases so it will never match even if someone tells you 100% guarantee. For 100% result and not catching by a naked eye the first thing you need to do is that you need to get a fresh door and then get it painted.,,
Dear friends I just got bought new facelift corolla and the driver side door got dented. I got it repainted(my mistake) from 3s dealer two times and still there is mismatch. What should I do,It will never be 100%. There would be angles in which it will be more difference. Check in broad day light . Also compound the car to match colour. It improves a lot .,,
Dear friends I just got bought new facelift corolla and the driver side door got dented. I got it repainted(my mistake) from 3s dealer two times and still there is mismatch. What should I do,Quite prominent. I guess they only painted one panel therefore this difference will always be there. The problem with Silver colour is whole side has to be showered with lacquer to match. Even in that case a slight difference is visible under certain angles and light conditions. Leave it as it is. Going to other painters will cause unnecessary expenditure and the result will still never be 100%. Silver is the worst colour to match.,,
Dear friends I just got bought new facelift corolla and the driver side door got dented. I got it repainted(my mistake) from 3s dealer two times and still there is mismatch. What should I do,Thats good. But your experience doesnt negate the fact that Silver is the worst colour when it comes to matching. I have a Silver car that has always gone to different Honda dealerships in Lahore for paintwork over the past 12 years of ownership. There has always been a difference in the colour after a repaint. For example I am yet to see a Silver repainted bumper on any car that matches 100% with the body. Not every body can recognise these mismatches neither they visible in all kinds of light conditions. Some match nearly perfect some poorly. But the difference is always there. He can give it a try but there is a high probability that it will not match.,,
Dear friends I just got bought new facelift corolla and the driver side door got dented. I got it repainted(my mistake) from 3s dealer two times and still there is mismatch. What should I do,I would believe what Toyota Airport said. Without showering the whole side with lacquer it is almost impossible to match silver.,,
Dear friends I just got bought new facelift corolla and the driver side door got dented. I got it repainted(my mistake) from 3s dealer two times and still there is mismatch. What should I do,Why not. I have a pre facelift corolla 2016 and i had one piece sprayed and not even from toyota i got it sprayed from HONDA Dealership as the guy is an old friend of mine and i didnt mind paying exorbitant prices as insurance was going to cover it And even toyota painters couldn't tell which panel was resprayed I can post pictures if you want and you wont be able to tell the difference,,
"Hi All,, As summers are here ! Most of the cars would be getting their cooling system serviced so thought to share this here.Just wanted to share what i got to know few days back regarding Denso A/C Compressors. Maybe i can save someone ending up destroying their AC compressor just because of lack of knowledge among the A/C service guys!  Denso Compressors should only be filled with ND-OIL 8 compressor oil.  I have Alto 660CC which has Denso Compressor, the A/C compressor was giving a strange noise while the car idles. As soon as i give accelarator the sound goes. In short the compressor becomes soundless on 1.5K RPM and above. Got it inspected from 3 - 4 wshops and all said to change the compressor as the noise is from inside the compressor. So got the old compressor out and took it as a sample to buy the exact thing. There On the compressor it was mentioned ""Only Use ND-OIL 8"" on the side of the compressor which would not have been visible to read if the compressor had not been taken out , bought the compressor from Bilal gunj and back to the wshop, when came the turn to put oil in it , the A/C guy brought a 1.5 liter water bottle which had oil in it to put it in the compressor.. I asked him which oil is this and he simply replied ""Compressor Oil hai ji"" ... I asked haaan leikin kya grade hai , koi code wagaira ? he said nai sir bas compressor oil k naam say milta hia Temple road say .. Hmmmmmm.... Asked 2 - 3 other A/C wshops and they also replied the same k jinaaab aik hi cheez hai , bas Oil daalna laazmi hota hai jo marzi daalo.. Lol.. Anyways I had already decided to only fill my compressor with ND OIL 8 as soon as i read it on the compressor, as there must have been a reason why it was mentioned on the compressor,, finally the oil was available at Punjab Car A/C.. Bought the oil from there and got it filled in the compressor.. Now if i wouldve gone for a normal A/C service, I wouldve never know that ND OIL 8 needs to be filled in it and eventually I wouldve ended up getting the desi oil filled eventually the compressor might go Bad OR Cease. As the A/C compressor is not taken out in case of just servicing the unit. From another source, i got to know that these 660CC cars have rotary compressors, So maybe thats the reason that they should only be used with specifically ND-OIL 8.. Just like NO SYNTHETIC OIL in rotary engines of Cars! only Mineral Motor oil should be used.. Still Not Sure. Maybe experts can tell.. ND-oil 8 is used in the following DENSO Compressor types: 10PA, 7SB, 6SE, SC, 6CA series","suniso make the compressor oil you mention and its quite pricey, expect to pay really high prices for it, good A/C shops invest in this and charge you appropriately, using the wrong oils in the system can severely damage it. Google R134a refrigeration lube and R12 lube, you will find out.",,

Asked 2 - 3 other A/C wshops and they also replied the same k jinaaab aik hi cheez hai , bas Oil daalna laazmi hota hai jo marzi daalo.. Lol.. Anyways I had already decided to only fill my compressor with ND OIL 8 as soon as i read it on the compressor, as there must have been a reason why it was mentioned on the compressor,, finally the oil was available at Punjab Car A/C.. Bought the oil from there and got it filled in the compressor.. Now if i wouldve gone for a normal A/C service, I wouldve never know that ND OIL 8 needs to be filled in it and eventually I wouldve ended up getting the desi oil filled eventually the compressor might go Bad OR Cease. As the A/C compressor is not taken out in case of just servicing the unit. From another source, i got to know that these 660CC cars have rotary compressors, So maybe thats the reason that they should only be used with specifically ND-OIL 8.. Just like NO SYNTHETIC OIL in rotary engines of Cars! only Mineral Motor oil should be used.. Still Not Sure. Maybe experts can tell.. ND-oil 8 is used in the following DENSO Compressor types: 10PA, 7SB, 6SE, SC, 6CA series","Ehsan4808;4294398: Bro, I am not sure but the mechanic tested the compressor by covering the pipes and spinning the pulley very fast . I think he was checking the pressure being built by the compressor.. As he denied 2 compressors after this pulley spin test. thanks for responce today i took my car to ac mech and we took out comperessor it was dry not running jammed then he just wanted to test my old comperessor with nd 8 oil as it was dry when it came out of car i already had bought a new sanden unit but he did not installed ran pully with oil and he turned the comp over for 30 mins or so and to every ones surprise original comperessor started working he said why u spending new sanden for 7k lets install it and check if it does not work then new one will be installed got that original comp in car testing for leaks and no leaks after that he filled gas and then it started cooling with Gas Alhumdulillah oem comp in my alto started working took it on motorway to check but cooling getting better and better returned brand new comp and original one is working again with no sounds or load on engine",,

"Hi Everyone, I have a car Suzuki Baleno in Maroon Color. It was already showered and the paint quality is good but the painting labor and denting work was not done properly on doors so they are full of unnecessary Poteen and still there are dents on them. Fenders and rest of the body is good. I need to get all poteen removed from them, get the denting done properly and get them repainted again with no or very very minimal poteen. I visited an expert painter in my area in Rawalpindi and he said that it will take approx 35 thousand rupees to repaint both sides of car and around 60,000 if I do the whole car. Denting charges (for removing current poteen and dents) are separate. Really painting costs this much? I checked the market and a very good quality paint costs around PKR 7000 per liter.

"It pains a lot if you buy a car and end up hearing its main bigen (main bearing) either making sound while starting in the morning or making it all day... So when you visit your mechanic and he finds you dumb, he is clever enough to suggest you a full overhaul and you feel so pissed off at your car then and why you brought it... Well here is a simple solution which will neither take you to an overhaul and I have done it not only myself but a couple of friends followed me back as well... If your main bigen starts to make noise, Ask your mechanic to remove the crankshaft without lowering your headgasket (Simply putting your engine out and crankshaft will be present at the bottom)... Once your crankshaft is out, If you're in Lahore go to Ittefaq refinery to Keynchi brigde road and drive in the direction i pointed out. Towards your left you will find Bhai Bhai Kharaadia... For other cities, go to a Kharadia that does Engines only (Bores, seals, walls, and blablabla)... Ask them to grind and polish the crankshaft and add a new main bearing Bigen set oil seal kit and whatever more they advice... Once done get your engine fitted back and you will see it will be all done for without any major overhaul... Because a major overhaul would be required in a case the car is eating up oil, if not follow this partial overhaul. Standard mechs advice full overhaul so they get labor for piston fitting and can strip u off budget.. So remember, everything has a solution.. THis is what i tried once and then a couple of friends followed it.. The kharadia expenses wont be more than 2k for a small 1000 cc car excluding parts....","firstly the correct name is Main and Big end bearings, the main bearings are which the crank spins on and the big ends are the big ends of the connecting rods, the other end of the connecting rods are called small ends which are called gudgeon pin. If your engine has cold start rattle firstly check that you are using the correct oil filter for your engine with a working antidrain back valve, using incorrect filters will cause bleed down and rattle. To correctly diagnose main and big end bearing failure, you are supposed to do an oil pressure test with the correct lubricating oil in the sump and the engine at correct normal operating temperature. If your oil pressure spikes on startup and then falls to below 10 psi pressure at normal temperature, and does not rise correctly when revved the clearances between the bearing journals is causing loss of pressure and eventual wear on the crank Such noise is also caused by ommitting the oil control orifice in the block which regulates flow volume between the block and head (if OHC engine) - What you posted is an acceptable practice only if the top end is certified to be good. I mean checked with tools not dancing around fire, voodoo, andaaza, noise etc etc. I can give you a rattle example of old 84-87 Honda civic 1.2 engines, they require an oil filter with a pressure relief valve which means that unless the oil pressure is high enough the oil filter will not allow filteration, this was done by Honda to ensure oil gets to the crank oiling holes immediately and when the entire oil system is full and the main oil gallery starts to pressurize the filter opens up and allows oil to be filtered. A mitsubishi filter (cheaper compared to Honda) also fits perfectly but lacks this function, this causes the crankshaft to rattle on startup, and your mechanic then tells you that engine ""over all"" required. :). Think wisely - there are factors in Pakistan that do not make sense anywhere else, they are caused by our love of shortcut, bypass, jugaar etc etc.",,
"It pains a lot if you buy a car and end up hearing its main bigen (main bearing) either making sound while starting in the morning or making it all day... So when you visit your mechanic and he finds you dumb, he is clever enough to suggest you a full overhaul and you feel so pissed off at your car then and why you brought it... Well here is a simple solution which will neither take you to an overhaul and I have done it not only myself but a couple of friends followed me back as well... If your main bigen starts to make noise, Ask your mechanic to remove the crankshaft without lowering your headgasket (Simply putting your engine out and crankshaft will be present at the bottom)... Once your crankshaft is out, If you're in Lahore go to Ittefaq refinery to Keynchi brigde road and drive in the direction i pointed out. Towards your left you will find Bhai Bhai Kharaadia... For other cities, go to a Kharadia that does Engines only (Bores, seals, walls, and blablabla)... Ask them to grind and polish the crankshaft and add a new main bearing Bigen set oil seal kit and whatever more they advice... Once done get your engine fitted back and you will see it will be all done for without any major overhaul... Because a major overhaul would be required in a case the car is eating up oil, if not follow this partial overhaul. Standard mechs advice full overhaul so they get labor for piston fitting and can strip u off budget.. So remember, everything has a solution.. THis is what i tried once and then a couple of friends followed it.. The kharadia expenses wont be more than 2k for a small 1000 cc car excluding parts....","This process is good to work, but requires the engine to be separated from the gearbox, the clutch/flex plate taken off, the timing system (belt/chain) taken off which in actual fact means that you are only leaving the head bolted to the block. Cranks usually dont wear off like that unless its a design fault or some other fault like missing oil control orifice etc. Best practice is to completely check the health of the engine with proper gauges etc and then choosing your step.",,

Your writing for the post right above recommending is not completely correct, big and main bearing noise is a rumbling sound and minor cases are heard on startup and in major cases can be heard while accelerating hard, in such cases the oil pressure warning light may also illuminate at hot idle due to massive oil pressure loss through the worn out bearing shells.

Secondly such mechanical noise has a rasp in it that is caused by worn out tappet rockers.

For main bearing diagnosis, you need to install an oil pressure gauge to the oil pressure switch port. The pressure would peak on cold and if it drops to below 10 psi on hot and cannot raise properly when revved - it shows bad crank bearings. Such failure can also be caused if the oil pump pickup tube was removed and installed without replacing the O ring, its supposed to be renewed everytime the oil pickup tube is dismounted.

Should i get ceramic coating to my new car??

Plz tell products or company or differences in price and product to select,"Think of Ceramic coating as a sacrificial layer of clear coat, only harder. The time duration of the guarantee/ warranty the applicator gives depends upon the quality of product, its application and follow up maintenance. And usually a careful applicator will promise you a reduced life span than what is advertised or claimed by the product manufacturer. Ceramic coat or not.....either way.....you should maintain your ride with microfiber cloths. Another option is PPF (Paint Protection Film) which IMHO seems to be a better option but expensive.",,

You are running way too much advance and are stabilizing at 12 afr with that much advance and no knock leads me to believe you have other mechanical issues like bad valves or bad valve timing even. The carburetor is the very last object to adjust on an engine, you first have to make sure everyrhing else is top notch, check the Intake for leaks Engine operating temperature (in ancient days we checked with multimeter or even heat marker) Correct valve timing and clearance - make sure the damn thing actually is on tdc when it says it is (sometimes the pointer mark/scale is also wrong) Correct pcv working, including no leaks on engine Correct distributor working (centrifugal and vacuum advance both) Airbox correctly seated to carb Carby with correctly levelled float and correct, idle, low and high jets, working and good sealing powervalve etc and clean emulsion passages.

The post discusses whether or not rats are attracted to luxury cars, particularly Benz. The user is curious to know if rats have a preference for high-end vehicles. -  - The discussion revolves around the possibility of rats being fond of the wiring and components inside luxury cars, such as Mercedes-Benz. Some forum members share their personal experiences of finding rat-infested cars and the damages caused by these rodents. -  - While there is no solid scientific evidence to confirm or deny this claim, the general consensus among the forum participants seems to lean towards supporting the idea that rats do indeed find luxury vehicles appealing due to their intricate wiring system. -  - Given that rats are notorious for chewing on various objects, it is not surprising that they may be attracted to the wiring found in vehicles. Moreover, luxury cars like Mercedes-Benz are equipped with more advanced electrical systems, which could be more enticing to the rodents. -  - To prevent rat infestation in their cars, some forum members suggest taking certain precautions like keeping the vehicles clean, parking in rodent-proof garages, and using repellents. Others recommend having regular maintenance check-ups to detect any signs of damage caused by rats. -  - In conclusion, while the idea of rats having a preference for Benz cars may seem unusual, the forum discussion highlights the potential risk of rodents causing damage to luxury vehicles. It is always advisable to take precautions to protect your car from any kind of infestation, be it rats or other pests.",,

"I have seen poor owners of AGS, CVT, and DCT based vehicles get shocking surprises during their ownership. They get disappointed after facing issues with these transmissions, and I get sad when I see owners and their transmission failures or when they blame the vehicle for not performing as they intended and the problem was their transmission choice, not the vehicle itself. So, I am writing this to help people make an informed decision about the transmission choice before purchasing a vehicle. 1: Early Transmission Failure These modern automatic transmissions are not as reliable as manual transmission or traditional 4-6 speed automatic transmissions. These new automatics can fail much earlier than you expect. You can prolong the life of the transmission by following some precautionary measures and changing driving behavior, which is different for each type of transmission, hence that's a topic of a different thread. For now, let's focus on ownership shocks. In case of AGS, the clutch plates can fail as early as 20,000-30,000 km. On the positive side, complete transmission failure is not common for AGS. Premature clutch failure can happen with dry clutch DCT as well. Early failures of CVT and DCT are observed between 60,000-100,000 km. You can search the PakWheels forums as a reference. 2: Transmission Repair/Replacement Cost AGS clutch and pressure plates are easily replaceable, and they can be replaced for approx PKR 40,000 from Suzuki dealerships. I am not sure about the complete AGS transmission price since whole transmission failure is not common as mentioned previously. Similarly, clutch replacement for DCT could be done, but I am not sure about the cost. Honda Vezel owners can contribute here. Time will tell how far Changan’s DCT based vehicles can go. When an issue is faced in CVT or DCT, dealerships will ask you to replace the transmission and according to them, it's not repairable and this is an international practice. Usually, dealerships don't repair CVTs and DCTs. New transmission won't be cheap. New Honda Civic CVT cost PKR 700,000 and Alsvin DCT cost PKR 1200,000 at the time of this writing. There are transmission shops outside of Pakistan who rebuild CVTs, but first the shop will access the condition of the damage and provide estimates for labor and parts. Sometimes this cost get closer to new transmission. In such cases, it's better to replace the transmission. I am not aware of any good transmission rebuilding shop in Pakistan. If there's any, do let us know in this thread. 3: Transmission fluid is expensive Gear oil for AGS, DCT and transmission fluid (referring CVTF as gear oil is wrong terminology) for CVT are very expensive when compared to gear oil for manual transmission and ATF for traditional automatics. They usually cost between PKR 7,000 - 15,000 at the time of this writing. Not only that, the frequency of the fluid change for CVT and DCT is much higher than manual transmission. Suzuki AGS and Alsvin DCT gear oil cost PKR 15,000 and Honda HCF-2 costs about PKR 7,000. Toyota CVT fluids also cost close to Honda. 4: DCT heats up in stop & go traffic Usually people complain about transmission heat up issue in Alsvin, but this issue is common in all DCT based vehicles. If you don't let the vehicle release the clutch fully in stop and go driving, the clutch will heat up, and a warning sign will appear in the dashboard cluster. This issue can happen with Suzuki AGS as well, but Suzuki vehicles don't show any heat up indicator in the dashboard cluster. You can avoid this issue by adjusting your driving technique, specially in stop and go traffic. Avoid frequent accelerations and let the distance between your vehicle and the one in front of you increase. This should be done to give the transmission a chance to fully release the clutch. Apart from that, it's better to use manual/sports mode in such situations to avoid frequent changing of gears in stop and go traffic. If you don't use manual mode, the computer will not shift to lower gear and tries to pick speed by slipping the clutch. 5: AGS and DCT are jerky Both AGS and DCT jerk in some driving situations, especially in low gears when you accelerate. It's more noticeable in slow moving traffic where you use brakes/accelerate frequently and specially with hard acceleration. This could be controlled with driving behavior as explained in point 4 above. Using manual mode and light acceleration reduce these jerks and when done properly could be eliminated. Remember, if the gear oil is cold, the jerk will stay no matter how you drive. It goes away once the gear oil warms up and with correct driving techniques. 6: CVT delay in initial acceleration When people move from any other transmission to a CVT based vehicle for the first time, they don't like the initial acceleration of the vehicle. When you press the accelerator, the actual acceleration starts with slight delay. This is known as the rubber band effect. Many manufacturers have fine-tuned their transmissions to reduce this as much as possible. So it depends how much rubber band effect you face based on the vehicle you drive. Some have negligible for a common man, and some have a lot. 7: CVT don't climb hills with ease There are a lot of complaints of fully loaded CVT vehicles not being able to climb very steep hills like Babusar Top in the Kaghan Valley. I remember one owner reported he had a hard time climbing a steep incline in the basement parking of some mall. CVT is not the favorite transmission for people who drive a lot in hilly areas. Conclusion All of these issues are not explained to fear you or the new car buyers. The point is to help you make an informed decision and choose the right transmission by knowing the common issues and maintenance and replacement (in case of failure) cost in advance, or leave these transmissions in the first place if you don’t want to spend hefty money on them. Many people sacrifice the reliability, maintenance cost, fuel economy, less power (transmission power losses) for the ease of driving these transmissions provide when compared to manuals. It all comes down to personal preference.","ifadey: Right now, Mazda is the only Japanese manufacturer who didn't move to CVT or DCT due to reliability issues. They are still using 6 speed autos. but not everyone likes to own a mazda, they use a smallish torque converter and engage its clutch almost too quickly - and then the fact that mazdas are very involved in driving - they provide a lot of road feedback - while most users want a car that floats - mazdas never floated. anyway - CVT are the cheapest transmissions to manufacture and ensure the manufacturer can get ultra great MPG numbers. The manufacturers using CVT dont give a hoot to user experience of it.",,

You can search the PakWheels forums as a reference. 2: Transmission Repair/Replacement Cost AGS clutch and pressure plates are easily replaceable, and they can be replaced for approx PKR 40,000 from Suzuki dealerships. I am not sure about the complete AGS transmission price since whole transmission failure is not common as mentioned previously. Similarly, clutch replacement for DCT could be done, but I am not sure about the cost. Honda Vezel owners can contribute here. Time will tell how far Changan’s DCT based vehicles can go. When an issue is faced in CVT or DCT, dealerships will ask you to replace the transmission and according to them, it's not repairable and this is an international practice. Usually, dealerships don't repair CVTs and DCTs. New transmission won't be cheap. New Honda Civic CVT cost PKR 700,000 and Alsvin DCT cost PKR 1200,000 at the time of this writing. There are transmission shops outside of Pakistan who rebuild CVTs, but first the shop will access the condition of the damage and provide estimates for labor and parts. Sometimes this cost get closer to new transmission. In such cases, it's better to replace the transmission. I am not aware of any good transmission rebuilding shop in Pakistan. If there's any, do let us know in this thread. 3: Transmission fluid is expensive Gear oil for AGS, DCT and transmission fluid (referring CVTF as gear oil is wrong terminology) for CVT are very expensive when compared to gear oil for manual transmission and ATF for traditional automatics. They usually cost between PKR 7,000 - 15,000 at the time of this writing. Not only that, the frequency of the fluid change for CVT and DCT is much higher than manual transmission. Suzuki AGS and Alsvin DCT gear oil cost PKR 15,000 and Honda HCF-2 costs about PKR 7,000. Toyota CVT fluids also cost close to Honda. 4: DCT heats up in stop & go traffic Usually people complain about transmission heat up issue in Alsvin, but this issue is common in all DCT based vehicles. If you don't let the vehicle release the clutch fully in stop and go driving, the clutch will heat up, and a warning sign will appear in the dashboard cluster. This issue can happen with Suzuki AGS as well, but Suzuki vehicles don't show any heat up indicator in the dashboard cluster. You can avoid this issue by adjusting your driving technique, specially in stop and go traffic. Avoid frequent accelerations and let the distance between your vehicle and the one in front of you increase. This should be done to give the transmission a chance to fully release the clutch. Apart from that, it's better to use manual/sports mode in such situations to avoid frequent changing of gears in stop and go traffic. If you don't use manual mode, the computer will not shift to lower gear and tries to pick speed by slipping the clutch. 5: AGS and DCT are jerky Both AGS and DCT jerk in some driving situations, especially in low gears when you accelerate. It's more noticeable in slow moving traffic where you use brakes/accelerate frequently and specially with hard acceleration. This could be controlled with driving behavior as explained in point 4 above. Using manual mode and light acceleration reduce these jerks and when done properly could be eliminated. Remember, if the gear oil is cold, the jerk will stay no matter how you drive. It goes away once the gear oil warms up and with correct driving techniques. 6: CVT delay in initial acceleration When people move from any other transmission to a CVT based vehicle for the first time, they don't like the initial acceleration of the vehicle. When you press the accelerator, the actual acceleration starts with slight delay. This is known as the rubber band effect. Many manufacturers have fine-tuned their transmissions to reduce this as much as possible. So it depends how much rubber band effect you face based on the vehicle you drive. Some have negligible for a common man, and some have a lot. 7: CVT don't climb hills with ease There are a lot of complaints of fully loaded CVT vehicles not being able to climb very steep hills like Babusar Top in the Kaghan Valley. I remember one owner reported he had a hard time climbing a steep incline in the basement parking of some mall. CVT is not the favorite transmission for people who drive a lot in hilly areas. Conclusion All of these issues are not explained to fear you or the new car buyers. The point is to help you make an informed decision and choose the right transmission by knowing the common issues and maintenance and replacement (in case of failure) cost in advance, or leave these transmissions in the first place if you don’t want to spend hefty money on them. Many people sacrifice the reliability, maintenance cost, fuel economy, less power (transmission power losses) for the ease of driving these transmissions provide when compared to manuals. It all comes down to personal preference.","Wait till you see some “driver hazraat” who hold the car on an uphill ascent with the clutch at bite point claiming that they are “saving” the brakes. 🤪 I usually have a special LOL moment when I see people dance the lever side to side to check neutral in order to start the engine, while never pressing in the clutch pedal. To the point that they have the clutch interlock disabled because “kya faltoo system hai” A simple one position check to check for a gear engagement and then out of it confirms neutral position. No need to dance the lever and cause the shift fork detents to work dry.",,
"I have seen poor owners of AGS, CVT, and DCT based vehicles get shocking surprises during their ownership. They get disappointed after facing issues with these transmissions, and I get sad when I see owners and their transmission failures or when they blame the vehicle for not performing as they intended and the problem was their transmission choice, not the vehicle itself. So, I am writing this to help people make an informed decision about the transmission choice before purchasing a vehicle. 1: Early Transmission Failure These modern automatic transmissions are not as reliable as manual transmission or traditional 4-6 speed automatic transmissions. These new automatics can fail much earlier than you expect. You can prolong the life of the transmission by following some precautionary measures and changing driving behavior, which is different for each type of transmission, hence that's a topic of a different thread.

"Hello everyone I need help in planning stuff for a SQ build, on a fairly flexible budget. I would like to call myself an audiophile as I am looking for quality rather than volume. Depth and separation of instruments is what I cherish while listening to music. What I need is information on what to buy and where to buy it in Lahore. I have been going through the forums here and I am open to order stuff online as long as the seller is trustworthy. I am big on an informed purchase and would really appreciate your help. Head Unit Pioneer DEH8850MP The prices for headunits are sky high these days and I plan to scavenge as much use out of this as possible. This head unit is pretty old and has been collecting dust for a lot of years. This was used in my Cultus back in 2014. It has all the SQ stuff which I need, DSP, crossovers, auto time alignment. I think I may be able to use it in an active setup. Through my research I have realised this used to be a pretty good back in 2000s. The only problem I have with it are that it is a single DIN unit and doesn't have bluetooth. But I can make do with using an USC-C DAC dongle. Currently my car has a cheap chinese head unit which costed like 5-6k a year ago. Front stage: I have spent the past week researching about different component speakers and shortlisted a few of them based on availability and budget. But now I have become a bit overwhelmed with information and need to know of any alternates from Hertz, Focal, Massive etc JBL GTO 609C Infinity Reference 6530 Sub stage: For this I just want a decent subwoofer, budget isn't very passionate about this. I am looking for a single subwoofer in a sealed enclosure Amplifier: Currently I have this stuff, note that this stuff is pretty old and has been lying around since late 2000s only to be used in my Cultus back in 2014 for a while before it was sold off: Boschmann PCH-6882EX Specs @ https://store9658340.ecwid.com/Boschmann-PCH-6882EX-p2681999571 JVC AX5700 Specs @ https://support.jvc.com/consumer/product.jsp?modelId=MODL027604&page=3&lang=es Sound treatment: I have treated the front doors and the rear wheel arches and trunk with Orientech 2mm sheets.","Your initial choice of the 609c and infinity 6530 are more than good enough. I'd go with the 6530 if the price differance isn't much Since you're only running front stage and a sub ( my 07 didn't have space for rear speakers in the doors ), best to use a 4 channel amp. There's no need for another 2 channel amp unless you want to run your 2 way comps active Amp prices have sky rocketed too. However, a good 4 channel that is a tad bit under rated and has enough juice to not let you wanting more from your speakers is the pioneer 4704. Sure the 6704 would be an even better choice but thats 30k+ these days. A 4704 will cost you in the ballpark of 24k The jbl cs1214 is a good entry level sub. I have it in sealed box lined with polyfill and it's doing a great job of keeping with my Helix F62c's. It's tight and accurate and a great sub to start with. Offcourse there are better options but I got that for under 20k and I don't regret it A good set of comps will cost you 25-30k A good 4 channel will cost you 25-40k A nice sql sub will cost between 20-25k Pay more and you can get better equipment. It's really upto you. Ask soundvalley in pindi, haroon radio in karachi, soundworks in lahore about products and prices. Lasersound is another shop in lahore too",,

I own a 2007 Honda Civic hybrid. It currently has 15-inch rims with 195/65R15 tires. I am considering installing 16-inch rims from a newer Civic model along with 205/55R16 tires. Would this be a wise decision?,"You will loose the comfort and the handling will suffer negatively. Tyres will rub the frame on lock to lock turning. Fuel mileage will go down significantly aswell. The suspension is designed for certain type of wheel. 16 inch rim of 8th gen civic is not the same as 10th gen spec wise, then again the suspension is tuned for that wheel. First hand experience.",,

Would this be a wise decision?,My experience: - Less comfortable. You'll feel the ups and downs of the plain road more. It is smooth but still you feel more. - Shocks compress too much. You can feel this on uneven roads or while turning. I don't know for now what effect it will have. - Handling a little difficult on above 100. I am not sure if it is related. Handling of this car is not that good anyway. Maybe I am saying this because I am used to hydraulic power steering. I didn't like the handling of electrical steering. - No noticeable difference in fuel economy. Maybe because it is hybrid. - Tyres didn't hit the frame. - Looks beautiful.,,

Ok Guys I have been waiting to do this for some time so here it is. I Was going for 5EFE but couldent find a clean engine so decided for 5AFE.

I can see all sensors hooked up if i look into engine bay only sensor that is not hooked is the one that is in the Air Cleaner box tht he will fix tomorow alongwith Tachometer. Now about wiring part bcoz I mostly run my car on CNG how can these sensors help? I mean if some sensor isnt working how its gona effect the cng performance? My mechanic unhooked a sensor that is hooked into the area where thermostate valve is he says the car should have raised RPM when he unhooked it so this sensor is not properlly working. I am feeling like an idiot i mean these mechanics dun kno anything about wiring and I also dont have time or enough energy to dig into this thing. So i will need maximum Help from you guys. ig- is ignition coil negative (coil switching) wire, its used ti run rpm - if your electric wala has problems tracing this wire he can also use the igf wire from the ignitor. the ecu looks at all sensors for various inputs - including some load sensors too to stabilise rpms - there is nothing that you disconnect to raise revs - whatever the person was upto, he was fooling you.",,

Please feel free to ask about Vehicle Tracking. The Best way to secure your Vehicle is to install the Tracker.,"Regarding the price issue, it's important to note the significant difference between prices in the US and Pakistan, with electronics often costing double in Pakistan due to factors like duties and other expenses. Importing items oneself can provide a clearer understanding of these discrepancies. For reference, websites like TechBargains can offer insights into gadget prices. While appreciating the provided information, I'm still seeking clarification on the effectiveness of Trakker installations in preventing vehicle theft. Let's maintain a respectful and constructive atmosphere, avoiding unnecessary conflicts and questioning others' skills or experiences. If there are doubts or concerns, direct communication can help clarify matters. Welcome to Pakwheels! Could you provide a brief introduction?

"I recently restored a Datsun 510 to its former glory. I wanted to put a bigger engine under the hood but was sceptical of the rear end bearing the punishment so i planned on sticking to the engine that was already installed (datsun120y). I got the engine overhauled and replaced everything and anything that i could find in the market. Since i live in Peshawar the availability of parts was near to 10% so it wasnt a very nice job. After the whole car was restored the engine started troubling me and would never drive proper so after being framed on bricks for 3 months i decided to swap the engine. Since the car comes with independent suspension i could not put in a big engine like an sr20 or the engine of my choice 4age, so i planned on bringing it to its BRE specs with not too much and not less. Ive finally installed a Pajero Jr's engine in it 1100cc makes 80 bhp and is pretty much the same spec as the transam winner 510 spec. What do u guys think about my choice and what do u think was a better alternate.. P.s: the car has amazing amounts of torque and drifts really smoothly (which i love)","As for as i think ,u opted for d best available option best of luck for d ride",,

Petrol variant has less maintenance but too heavy on fuel. 1KZ-TE is better in terms of maintenance as compared to 1KD-FTV. 1KD-FTV is not designed to run on low quality diesel as in Pakistan. Nozzle injectors get damaged soon and are also too costly. it is better to go for 1KZ. As far as petrol and diesel fuel consumption is compared then diesel gives better mileage than petrol.

"Hello everyone, does anyone know of a workshop in Islamabad where I can find skilled professionals who are proficient in MIG welding?","MIG welding, also known as Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW), is a form of welding that uses a wire electrode and a shielding gas to create an electric arc between the electrode and the metal being welded. The electrode is fed through a welding gun and the shielding gas, usually a mixture of argon and carbon dioxide, is used to protect the weld from atmospheric contamination. -  - MIG welding is a popular method for joining different types of metals, including steel, stainless steel, and aluminum. It is commonly used in various industries such as automotive, construction, and manufacturing. -  - During the welding process, the electric current passes through the wire electrode and generates heat, which melts the metal and forms a weld pool. The weld pool then solidifies, creating a strong joint between the two pieces of metal. -  - MIG welding offers several advantages, including high welding speeds, ease of use, and the ability to weld in different positions. It also produces clean and smooth welds with minimal splatter or slag, reducing the need for extensive post-weld clean-up. -  - Overall, MIG welding is a versatile and efficient welding technique that is widely used in many applications due to its effectiveness and reliability.",,
"Hello everyone, does anyone know of a workshop in Islamabad where I can find skilled professionals who are proficient in MIG welding?",mig welding is metal inert gas welding.. the filler electrode melts and fill the gap between the metal... however due to the high temperatures the metal oxidises immediately... so to prevent that an inert gas like argon is continuously sprayed on the welded area while welding to prevent any air(oxygen) in that area. metals like aluminium are welded this way.,,

I am thinking of getting a 2005-2006 model, possibly priced between 6 to 6.5 lakh. I saw your thread about your interest in buying a Baleno. Why didn't you choose Liana instead? When I sold my previous Baleno, I had planned to buy a Liana from 06 or 07. Here in Islamabad, it ranges from 700k to 775k in good condition. However, many people advised against buying a Liana due to problems with its coils and expensive parts. But, in my opinion (shared by some Liana owners who are my friends), if you can afford to get all the necessary service and work done by Suzuki professionals, then Liana is a good option. But if you prefer going to local mechanics, then Liana is not a suitable choice. I decided to go for the Baleno again, despite it being more expensive than Liana. This is because local mechanics are able to handle it easily and its parts are relatively less expensive (or at least I believe so). Plus, it fits in my garage, unlike larger cars such as Liana, City > 2004, Civic, Corolla, etc.",,

Yesterday's hailstorm was very rough and my car although parked inside garage but unfortunately the trunk was not in shade. There are around 15-20 small dents on the trunk and as the color of my car is black plus i try to keep it very clean all the time those dents are really haunting me now I tried searching on forums for any solution like vacuum suction or dry denting but couldn't find any answer. So can any body guide me what should I do to remove those dents? I took it to a reliable denter but he was of idea that these cant be repaired and either i let them like this or i should replace the trunk with a new one same color (which i dont want to do). Also read somewhere to use hair dryer to heat up the dented area and then try removing it. Does that work? ---feeling depressed---,"No need to feel depressed man. Be happy. These small dents can be cured to perfection. Be thankful that it's only trunk. I faced the similar back in year 2013 and my 3 cars were battered and got them fixed without repaint.

"AoA! There are 3 options I have come across: 1- Woofer Box and Amplifier in trunk. This occupies a lot of space. Will a small box with 6 inch woofer do the job? If yes the where can i get those from since they're not common. 2- Bass Tube in trunk It's famous that it occupies lesser space but I think it's just better fitting and better shaped. Otherwise it still occupies lots of area, almost equal to a box. They also come with built-in amplifier but need to know where I can get those in Karachi in cheaper price range. 3- Under-seat Subwoofer: This seem like a great option as it fits easily under car seat and has built-in amplifier. But some say that the built-in amplifier heats up quick as they are placed in confined spaces (like under the seat). Will it sound good if I place it in trunk? Also, will it give good quality bass if I don't intend to make people outside the car notice or listen? Just need normal bass inside the car. 4- Door Speakers Some sellers are also claiming that few JBL / Pioneer etc models will give normal/decent quality bass including the ""humming"". Others are saying it's not possible given the little space in doors. But then underseat woofer also works in little space.. 5- Free Air Also came across this option where the concept is to make your car's trunk or cabin a ""box"" for the woofer. No idea how to do that without lots of experiments and will it even work without much altering of interior. So what should I opt for given that I don't want to spend a lot. The car is new shape Honda City and it's just that the existing setup isn't giving any ""humming"" bass at all at any volume. Making the car vibrate or making the whole neighborhood listen is ""not"" what I want. Just decent bass inside the car at low & medium volumes. Will appreciate if someone can help me out with saving boot space and money both.","under seat powered subs are absolutely fine. new ones are a bit expensive though. A member here usually lists them which come in japanese imports. That's the easiest bet. upgrading your stock speakers with some aftermarket ones will also increase the midbass you are looking for. But don'e expect wonders because your stock headunit doesnt produce the kind of power an amplifier would. Regardless, the difference will be quite noticeable over the stock speakers Sound deadening your doors will also increase midbass while eliminating unwanted resonance. Depending on the sub, a 10""-12"" can easily fit in a 0.75-1 cu.ft sealed box which won't take that much space. The box does not need to be a square with a internal volume of 0.75-1 cu.ft. An angled box will take less space when pushed to the back of the trunk",,

"Hi all So i want to install a good sound system in my honda city 2020 and i wanna go with the components. It would be my first time using components, are they any good in providing efficient bass and sound in the car. One dealer suggested me to go with MTX Black Thunder BLK 625 with 2 channel rockmars amp 3600 watts. The price he gave me for black thunder 16k Rock mars 2 channel amp 6k Copper wiring 3k Is that a good build as i may be investing nearly 25k for this system. i need some good advice regarding this P.s i cant sacrifice my boot space for a subwoofer so i only want good quality speakers","You may get better options in the same range. Flux neo would cost about 16k. Infinity alpha 650c are for around 13k and are more neutral sounding than MTX. there are even better options if you can raise taht budget to 20k with the JBL gto's, infinity reference etc. Never been a fan of any chinese amp like Rockmars etc. But since this is a begginer setup, you may opt for it to power your comps. However, to really setup a good sound stage, I'd suggest you also invest in a subwoofer in a sealed enclousure. So even if you can't get that now, I'd suggest you plan ahead and opt for a 4 channel amp so you may have 2 free channels to power up the sub. I'd suggest you opt for atleast some good quality ofc 8 gauge power/gnd wire and RCA cables. There are great stores to buy authentic items from so always mention which city you are from and members can help you out",,

"Hello guys, car in discussion is HONDA CITY IDSI recently, during a brief highway trip, the heat up sign showed. I stopped the car immediately, arranged water. It took me around 10-15 min. I opened the bonnet n filled the reservoir tank, but it had enough water as it seemed. Then opened radiator cap (there was no vapors) n poured water, but it seemed also had enough water. I drove back, n during this time many times heat sign showed n i turned off the engine, waited for some time and drove back home. I checked at parking, there was no water leak, fans were turning on (may be AC, as i didn't check without AC), and heat sign appearing. Due to heavy rains, i didn't get it checked for 2-3 weeks. Then, by connecting obd, i checked the temp rise via it. Before going to mechanic, i washed externally the radiator, if there was dust blocking heat flow. Then city drive rose the temp upto around 100°C. Mechanic suggested to get radiator cleaned, so i did. It was dirty but not that much as much. It seemed usual,radiator guy said, it was dirty. After reinstalling radiator, when he was checking for fans to run, temp rose to 115C n then he revved engine, there heat sign blinked n fan started. So i drove back to mechanic, he removed thermostat n said might there be blockage in the engine block. So, i asked him to close it as such n put in radiator flush in it. Then on next day, i drove around 150 km on highway. Temp was rising upto 100C but when i came back, noticed that rubber hose to heater core was leaking, got it done.

Should i use it too before citric acid flush???And is it necessary to use hose pipe to drain all flush, as i might not have the access.

"Hello guys, car in discussion is HONDA CITY IDSI recently, during a brief highway trip, the heat up sign showed. I stopped the car immediately, arranged water. It took me around 10-15 min. I opened the bonnet n filled the reservoir tank, but it had enough water as it seemed. Then opened radiator cap (there was no vapors) n poured water, but it seemed also had enough water. I drove back, n during this time many times heat sign showed n i turned off the engine, waited for some time and drove back home. I checked at parking, there was no water leak, fans were turning on (may be AC, as i didn't check without AC), and heat sign appearing. Due to heavy rains, i didn't get it checked for 2-3 weeks. Then, by connecting obd, i checked the temp rise via it. Before going to mechanic, i washed externally the radiator, if there was dust blocking heat flow. Then city drive rose the temp upto around 100°C. Mechanic suggested to get radiator cleaned, so i did. It was dirty but not that much as much. It seemed usual,radiator guy said, it was dirty. After reinstalling radiator, when he was checking for fans to run, temp rose to 115C n then he revved engine, there heat sign blinked n fan started. So i drove back to mechanic, he removed thermostat n said might there be blockage in the engine block. So, i asked him to close it as such n put in radiator flush in it. Then on next day, i drove around 150 km on highway. Temp was rising upto 100C but when i came back, noticed that rubber hose to heater core was leaking, got it done. Next day, i had to go to krchi early morning, so i drove with flush in the engine, temp was around 70C. I replaced the flush with tap water n came to my city driving arounf 500km. At time temp was 70-90C. Since, there has been no leakage, what could be the issue??? And now i m planning to clean the system with fresh water, get thermostat reinstalled and fill up with coolant.

"All, Can any body here please tell how can we test the ignition coil primary circuit, if its working or not. problem is unable to start the car, it takes self but there is no current in the lead coming out (secondary circuit) from coil to distributor. This happens rarely. but i am unable to diagnose what is the root cause. Road side mechanics are able to start the car by fiddling with the wiring (probably making a direct contact from battery to coil) but they themselves have no clue what they do to make it start. Things already tested and tried. have changed/ checked the coil lead. have checked when ever this happens the coil gets current (12v) from battery when the switch is in ON position. There is no current in the coil secondary coil when i crank the engine. coil seems to be in good health, once it get started it runs like a charm not a single missing what so ever. Not sure how to check the pulse circuit ( from distributor) how can i check if the distributor is generating the required pulse or not ? The most annoying thing is this behavior occurs rarely, and leaves back no symptoms to trace it. My personal opinion is that there could be some fault with coil primary circuit, but i am not sure how to test the circuit completely. Any help in this regard will be highly appreciated. Thanks.","if yours is the EFI cultus - then make absolutely sure that you are not having simple main relay issues, In an EFI engine - the distributor houses two or one sensors - just cam or crank and cam both. and all send signals to the ECU - the ECU then switches the coil on and off for firing the plugs. Its not a direct connection to the coil. By your problem it seems that you are seeing crank sensor issues As for checking the sensor signal pulses, you need a DVOM to measure AC volts while cranking, if you see slight voltage on the sensors output you are good, OR if you want to be real finicky use an oscilloscope",,

The 12V that you are seeing at the sensor is activation current from the main relay. Im not in paki at the moment and Im a little hazy on the new cultus, but its distributor should have three wires coming to it, - one 12V +ve one 12V -ve and one signal output - from the cam position sensor, I dont believe that a modern EFI car can be equipped without cam and crank sensors, (come to think of it, how the ECU time the injectors and ignition then).",,

There is no input going into the distributor for any sensor. what i believe is that there is some mechanical switch ( may b some contact point sort of rotor) in the distributor which operates a magnetic switch (pulse generator). The only difference i see is this magnetic switch has been replaced with traditional ""POINT"" we used to have in old cars. i have consulted few motor electricians locally including PAK SUZUKI, and they say there is no sensor in the distributor. One more thing i would like to know.... from where the coil gets primary current when u crank the engine ? definitely there are 2 circuits which provide the current to coil.. one in the ON position and the other while cranking. Thanks. So you mean to say there is no ignitor in the ignition circuit and there is no wiring going from the distributor into the main EFI wiring harness, but somehow this engine runs. HOW does it adjust ignition timing? If pak suzuki are telling you there is nothing in the distributor so what is that little thing inside the distributor, The only similar thing Ive seen to what you are saying was an old Mazda 4 cyl 626 EFI setup, The engine had a crank and cam sensor and also had a distributor, inside the distributor was the tiny ignitor which was fed input from the ECM - and a couple of wires ran from it to the ignition coil placed outside the distributor. The cranking circuit is also connected to the ECU - its branched off from the key that makes the ECM go into starting mode - higher fuel flow from injectors and advanced ignition timing forcing the engine to start easily.",,

Guys - need guidance. I need to equip my new car with an aftermarket sound system It's a civic 2022. Need to install front stage and amp with a decent headunit. My proposed items are: - Focal PS 165V1 for front with Trend Damping sheet on the door - Focal Auditor 4 channel or Hifonics 4ch or Gladen 4ch - Some good quality RC Leads with proper grounding. - Pioneer HU (need android auto) Budget is 200-250K. Keeping stock backstage on amp. Moderate gain level. No subwoofer. Please input on this setup.,"With that budget, the equipment you have posted in quite mediocre tbh. Also that Android auto unit might eat up majority of your budget.",,

Pioneers Android Auto compatible headunits start around 70k last I checked and go upto 100k or beyond. So it's upto you which one you want. Consider that prices might have fluctuated Something to remember, ALOT of the Focal stuff being sold here in Pakistan are copies and I'm talking about some pretty well known shops. Consider where you are buying your things from. Also, demo the speakers because you need to know what type of sound you like. Focals have a distinctive bright sound which some people love and some don't. @yawar538 might be aware of better components that are available in your budget. You can also contact Shehryar at soundvalley (pindi) or Haroon Radio in Karachi. Also, what exactly is trend dampening sheet?",,

"Guys is there a difference between cutting cream and Compound? If there is a difference, which one is better to use?

Compounds are usually used for aggressive cutting.,,
"Guys is there a difference between cutting cream and Compound? If there is a difference, which one is better to use? Asking for white color car kindly share your experiences on this topic","For water spots, try any descaler to remove them. Then use polish to remove the paint etchings. Polish is like compound but with less cutting ability. Don't confuse it with wax. People in Pakistan refer to wax as polish well. You can use vineger as an alternate to proper descaling product as Saad mention. Or you can use any budget descaling product from cash n carry like from astonish. I have personally used vinegar technique and found it pretty effective if you use the proper technique. The key is to let the water spots soak in vinegar for 5 min and then try to wipe the area using microfiber towel. Repeat these steps until desired results are achieved. You can use a towel soaked in vinegar solution or use any wax applicator pad soaked in the same solution and keep using cross hatch pattern until the water spots are gone",,

"Guys is there a difference between cutting cream and Compound? If there is a difference, which one is better to use? Asking for white color car kindly share your experiences on this topic",Bhai I have dealt with a similar issue recently. The yellowing or spots on my car were of very minor nature so a simple 'Scratch out' available everywhere solved my issue. What I did was that I attaches a cotton pad attachment on my home drill and primed the pad with Scratch out and used it throughout. Results were amazing and the car looked new again. Scratch out is so fine that it cannot dig deep into paint. My drill is a variable speed one so I kept the rpms low just to be safe. I was reluctant before trying this but I was pleasantly surprised after getting amazing results. Do apply wax or paint sealant afterwards for long term protection and cover your car with a good waterproof cover. In Lahore nowadays due to pollution its a common problem. Normal/factory chrome parts get corroded and dripping water smears that corrosion on every rain. Acid rains are also a big reason.,,

"I have come across two kinds of sprays that seem to be used in cleaning MAF sensor, need help of experts to know which one I can use. Pictures are attached.","there is no set time interval for cleaning. The cleaning has been put by diagnostic technicians. Cleaning a hot wire MAF is done when the hot wires become contaminated with oil or dirt - This is seen via the MAF flow PID in OBD diagnosis - if the sensor is not registering correct values then the MAF sensor is suspect (please note the suspect). The MAF sensor can be registering a fault even when there is a leak in the air tube after the MAF or even the intake manifold gasket or even throttle body gasket. Diagnose it correctly first then proceed to clean. Diagnosis also encompasses reading the fuel trims (where applicable). Dont just make it a habit of shooting cleaners at the MAF every 6 months because you think its a good idea, It can destroy it too. Also note that not all types of MAF can be cleaned, e.g. hot film maf or karmann vortex type should never be cleaned with anything. It kills them dead immediately. - Use a non residue degreaser to clean it - make sure that degreaser does not harm the nylon housing of the MAF either.",,

Car speedometer show higher speed than actual ....it increases to 100 while I'm driving at 60 2. The car looses pulses on higher speed i.e. 90-100(showing on Meter 135) , the car pulse looses pulse for brief moment and then it's back however the behavior is constant when driving on higher speed 3.

"AOA Everyone. I recently purchased Toyota Alpha 2014 (7 seater) model from a relative. The Odo-meter reads about 180K Km s, we imported the car ourselves, so I'm pretty sure about original mileage. Anyways, once I purchased the car, I changed spark plugs, transmission fluid, engine oil, oil filter, air filter and AC filter. The coolant for radiator is still within decent limit. Also got new Michelin tyres 215/65/16 and drive with 31 front and 30 PSI rear wheel air pressure. ( mentioned in the car door along with wheelbase information) Now with regular fuel I’m getting 14km/L, which is low average given my experience with 3rd Gen and 2nd Gen Prius. I was hitting 20+ with my 3rd Gen 1.8 Prius. I asked mechanic and he said that drive few tanks of High Octane and the average will start to improve. I did that, and on High Octane the average (Highway + city), I am getting is around 16.5Km/L or something. I usually drive in city and over the weekend I go to my hometown Okara from Lahore. What else I should look for to improve mileage ?","To address the fuel weeping issue, it's recommended to schedule a diagnostics appointment at Obama Car Care Centre in Tipu Block, Garden Town, by dialing 0321 4106898. The culprit may be a faulty fuel filter in the fuel tank. 2) Prioritize checking the condition of the batteries, especially since you're familiar with Prius operations. This assessment can help determine if the charging or discharging process is functioning correctly. 3) The average fuel efficiency of the Alpha model, as provided by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM), is 17 kilometers per liter. Considering its hybrid nature, anything above 13 kilometers per liter is deemed acceptable. However, factors like size and aerodynamics can lead to a 4 kilometers per liter decrease in fuel efficiency. This information is based on personal experience with the model. 4) Regarding tire size, the 215/65R16 may be too big and heavy. Alternatives like the 205/60R16 or 215/55R16 could be more suitable. 5) Acknowledging a previous mistake, the correct tire size is 215/60/R16. Gratitude is expressed to @capsat for assistance, and the issue will be addressed promptly. 6) An update reveals that after cleaning the throttle and applying grease, fuel consumption has improved. Refueling with RON97 and RON92 yielded mileage of 17KM/L and 20KM/L, respectively, indicating a positive impact on efficiency, especially for daily commuting within Lahore.",,

Yes, when there is some electrical load, the RPM drops and this increase in RPM should be just to take it back to normal RPM but this is not how its working right now. The RPM shoots when the headlights, blower, defogger or radiator fan is ON. Since the vacuum solenoid is working now, I will take the car to some mechanic who has gun and will ask him to set 950 RPM under load and no-load conditions. But only a few mechanics have that gun, rest all adjust RPM by guess. a multimeter that can read Hz can be your rpm meter for setting idle speed.",,
"Assalamualaikum! I recently had problem in my BMW X1. I fuelled up my car with super from PSO defence main boulevard and went to office. Usually i always filled the car with high octane ron 97 but this time since they did not had it and my car was empty, i had to fill it up. But before doing so i emptied an entire bottle of octane booster of ’STP’ brand in the fuel tank. The car drove normal until the reserve light came on, then the knocking started. At first i thought it was not a biggie. But then after i went and parked at home, the car wouldn’t start. When i would hit engine start button , engine would start for 2 seconds then shut down immediately. I kept repeating this and engine kept shutting down. I didn’t know what to do so i called DEWAAN BMW MOTORS office in Lahore. Told them about the situation, they said they would need to get it checked and i would need to send the car to their showroom through carriage. When I asked them to send their technician, they refused, saying that they did not had relevant equipment fpr mobile workshop. So i asked another mechanic INH EXPRESS near airport road to come and check. Preliminary investigation revealed that their was some problem with piston. I couldn't believe it so I sent the car to their workshop. Turns out, 1 of the 3 piston was damaged beyond repair! I was SHOCKED! My car had only +22,000 kms on it, it was only 2 years old! So i called DEWAN MOTORS once again and apprised them about the situation. They told me that they cannot do anything without looking at the car themselves. Meaning, i would have to ask INH EXPRESS to close up my engine and send the car to them so they can come to same conclusion. I asked them about spare parts, if they had any pistons available, to my surprise, they did NOT had any parts! What kind of after sale service is this? They sold thousand of cars and still did not had any spare party in inventory? I was told that the showroom would have to order parts from Germany! Since my brother already had a bad experience with them earlier, they took very long and charges were too high, I asked INH EXPRESS to order them and fix my car. It took 2 months for me to drive again and i had to pay roughly 325k! I was so enthusiastic to buy X1 as i’m an old BMW fan. But this incident and the pathetic service has taught me a lesson! I would HIGHLY advise everyone NOT to buy BMW from Dewan motors to avoid sheer disappointment and despair in future! I can’t seem digest the fact that why do they still have the agency? How can a dealership function without spare parts? I will also write to BMW head quarter and apprise them of this situation. How can we expect to enjoy this machine with this kind of service? Simply deplorable!","I have seen faliures of a lot of bmw, gm and toyota engines with the variable type oil pumps, the damage is not due to wrong fuel unless you fill it with 75 octane fuel, it wont even run smoothly after that, that stp octane booster is a joke. Never use that even in a cheap brand. It can severely damage stuff. The ecu literally signals the half check light and shuts off boost build from the turbocharger (wastegate wide open) and kills valvetronic too (if equipped) and goes to throttle blade mode. As soon as knock while running is detected. The knock you heard was probably the connecting rod slapping around due to oil starvation, bmw n55 are also seeing this even after oil change done by idiots. The filter is installed dry on those engines, or you can have an airbubble in the oil filter can or the pump itself (same issue as 5cyl ford pickup engine from turkey). Or you tried to follow euro oil change interval in Pakistan and sludged the engine. The damage was already there, what you heard was the final call of death. The knock you heard was mechanical not spark knock. Bmw sell the pistons in complete sets only, if the crank is salvageable, rebuild it and install new timing casette too. Make sure to replace all bolts with new and make sure the workshop knows what to do, there is no timing mark on these engines, they are held in time by friction only which require tooling to lock timing and huge tools to tighten. Make sure shop has tools to work on the cyl head too (it can be removed as one piece but is difficult) Or just sell the vehicle and write off your loss as local agents dewan are ""dewanay"" even if you got the parts their techs wouldnt know their ass from their elbow, forget fix",,

As the title suggests I am interested in taking my car (2009 Corolla 2.0d) to a reliable workshop in Karachi to check out its suspension and power steering rack/assembly. For the past several weeks I have heard a faint sound coming from the front right hand side of the car but only when driving over a bad or rough patch of road. I don't THINK its the suspension. I have a feeling something is not right with the steering rack/assembly as the car tends to drift towards the left even though I recently had the alignment redone. Several months ago the front right tyre went into an open manhole at some speed. The impact was enough to slightly bend the rim (stock toyota rim) of the front right tyre. At the time everything else seemed fine with the car so I had the rim replaced (eventually bought new tyres too) and continued driving without any problems. But now I feel that I sometimes hear a sound coming from the same area which took the impact many months ago. Can't describe the sound exactly. Not like something is obviously broken because the sound is not continuous. Sounds almost as if something is loose and needs tightening. The reason I feel it could be the steering rack is because a few times I have felt a slight vibration in the steering wheel.

But now I feel that I sometimes hear a sound coming from the same area which took the impact many months ago. Can't describe the sound exactly. Not like something is obviously broken because the sound is not continuous. Sounds almost as if something is loose and needs tightening. The reason I feel it could be the steering rack is because a few times I have felt a slight vibration in the steering wheel.

Can you suggest me a brand name for oil? Hire a good workshop to repair your bikes and make sure they follow correct repair procedures even involving proper sealants, you should buy a case of spray chain lubricant and have someone/riders spray it on the chain every 2 weeks for proper service life. Similarly a small supply of WD40 and some proper degreaser and shampoo will keep the bikes like new. For oils buy an old 20 litre oil bottle/drum - and get it filled at a proper licensed depot with the oil brand of your choice bearing oil quality marking of API SG 20W50, caltex, Total, Shell all sell it. It will be considerably cheaper than buying small bottles. You can even get wholesale prices for disposable spares if you are constantly maintaining them e.g. air filter, gasket sets, clutch friction set, chain case, brake shoes, buffers, bulbs, lens covers.

By per piece, I mean the cost of denting and painting individual parts such as the bonnet, bumper, fender, etc. Specifically, I am looking for information regarding the cost for models such as Mehran, Cultus, Honda, Coure, and Corolla. I would appreciate serious comments only. Thank you.",I have a question for you..... what would be the cost for complete denting painting of 2 panels (rear door+rear quarter panel) for Honda City Silver??? And tell me abt your matching skills?? Are you going to give me atleast 90% match to other panels which are in their original paint???,,

Thanx","buy good quality brake parts - always. And whenever you change your brake hardware be sure that you yourself buy some Antisieze for the back of the pads/shoes high temp silicone based grease or similar for the sliders and anti-rattle clips Flush brake fluid (takes about 2 bottles in a largish jap sedan) as the system is not cyclic (looped) the worn out brake fluid sits near the brake calipers/piston eating them away. Takes one empty jam jar - a hole in it the lid a piece of brake pipe leading to the bottom, some clear pipe, grease and some slow pumping for about 5 minutes on each wheel. And if your favorite mechanic does not have a large G clamp to push the brake pistons back into the calipers - make a deal in supplying him one or buy one for yourself and make him use it anytime he does a brake job on your car - The screwdriver technique usually used rips the protective dust boot on the piston",,

"This very good atricle was written by Omer Saleem, i am posting it here with his permission Quite recently I experienced a strange rise in transmission problems with most Toyotas running on the Super CVT-I transmission. I did some research and what I ended up discovering was shocking if nothing else. Most mechanics would not even know that these transmissions DO NOT run on Toyota T-IV or Toyota WS oil but instead require the TOYOTA CVT-TC oil and then there was the common problem I heard that the oil mysteriously disappears from most cars. However now that I have done my research that’s not true at all, infact the prime reason in most transmission failures is that the mechanics end up over filling the chamber, thus damaging the internal gearbox and pump seals. Here is what actually happened with my Belta 2 days ago: When you open up the drain plug for any of the K-series CVT transmissions which Toyota is putting in most of its newer models, only about 500ml or less of the transmission fluid drains out, leading one to believe that the transmission was running without oil, but that is absolutely not the case. The drain plug has an internal drain tube which extends about a little more than 2 inches inside the chamber, this causes the oil level to just drop till the mouth of this tube and hence the mystery disappearance behind the transmission oil. In order to fully drain the transmission oil, you will need to open up the oil chamber and drain out the fluid. This will also require you to replace the two gaskets which are firmly placed on top of the chamber. After completely draining the oil, about 3.8-4.0 liters of oil is taken up by the transmission. Then to make matters worse, Toyota hasn’t really provided with a dipstick or a gauge to check the level of the transmission fluid. The mechanics even at Toyota Southern argued that the side housing nut is the correct place to feed oil from and that it should be filled unless it levels off around that point. The truth is that if you do end up filling to that level you would be over-filling the chamber with about 3.5 liters of transmission oil and that can cause some serious irreparable damage. The correct way to fill the transmission fluid is via the oil feed port shown in the pictures attached below.My Belta had gone through all of the above but some timely research saved the car. I have also attached some detailed pictures and descriptions for the transmission oil change procedure. Last but not the least, the issue can potentially affect all Toyota CVT transmission system manufactured by AISIN. The following are the vehicle models and transmissions which might be affected by the same problem. This bulletin concerns the following Toyota models and transmission codes : Transmission Codes: K110, K111, K111F, K112, K112F, K210, P210, K310, K311, K311F, K410, K41A.

Someone PMed me about the change and I advised the same. you use the same allen key in the tube that you used to remove the main sump plug, unless someone has broken it internally. The first car I ever changed the fluid on was a Belta and Toyota Eastern Motors had filled it to the brim, it had severe slippage issues. the good part of removing the pan is that you can clean out the swarf in it and replace the filter too, BUT PLEASE make sure that NOTHING and absolultely nothing contaminates the transmission, not even fine lint. always use a lint free cloth and extremely clean workshops to remove the tranny oil pan.",,

(large plug), wait till it runs out, allow to trickle, plug up sump and fill hole, done. The strainer in place makes it a level check, removal of it allows fluid drain, just like nearly all RWD toyotas now have two holes in the sump one for checking one for draining. anyway... The people who have built the thing are better qualified to determine the service procedure, so best follow them. And you did just the right thing of asking procedure from the service tech.",,
"This very good atricle was written by Omer Saleem, i am posting it here with his permission Quite recently I experienced a strange rise in transmission problems with most Toyotas running on the Super CVT-I transmission. I did some research and what I ended up discovering was shocking if nothing else. Most mechanics would not even know that these transmissions DO NOT run on Toyota T-IV or Toyota WS oil but instead require the TOYOTA CVT-TC oil and then there was the common problem I heard that the oil mysteriously disappears from most cars. However now that I have done my research that’s not true at all, infact the prime reason in most transmission failures is that the mechanics end up over filling the chamber, thus damaging the internal gearbox and pump seals. Here is what actually happened with my Belta 2 days ago: When you open up the drain plug for any of the K-series CVT transmissions which Toyota is putting in most of its newer models, only about 500ml or less of the transmission fluid drains out, leading one to believe that the transmission was running without oil, but that is absolutely not the case. The drain plug has an internal drain tube which extends about a little more than 2 inches inside the chamber, this causes the oil level to just drop till the mouth of this tube and hence the mystery disappearance behind the transmission oil. In order to fully drain the transmission oil, you will need to open up the oil chamber and drain out the fluid. This will also require you to replace the two gaskets which are firmly placed on top of the chamber. After completely draining the oil, about 3.8-4.0 liters of oil is taken up by the transmission. Then to make matters worse, Toyota hasn’t really provided with a dipstick or a gauge to check the level of the transmission fluid. The mechanics even at Toyota Southern argued that the side housing nut is the correct place to feed oil from and that it should be filled unless it levels off around that point. The truth is that if you do end up filling to that level you would be over-filling the chamber with about 3.5 liters of transmission oil and that can cause some serious irreparable damage. The correct way to fill the transmission fluid is via the oil feed port shown in the pictures attached below.My Belta had gone through all of the above but some timely research saved the car. I have also attached some detailed pictures and descriptions for the transmission oil change procedure.

I had sprayed Fluid Film on undercarriage of my car through some spray cans I got someone to bring from the US. But it's not feasible to cover the whole undercarriage with just cans.

Then rub to taht side which have still rust. Then look inside again. Do this process till you remove the rust from mash. After cleaning the rust mash will look like this.   6. Now start the engine for 1 minutes and give race to 3 rpm after every 5 sec.. 7. Now switch off the engine. Now mash will look more clean.   8. Now install oxygen senser on its place and conect the conector on its place. Congrags! You have serviced the Catalytic Converter sucessfully! If check engine light appear then dont worry. Just disconect Positive + panel of battery for 1 minute and then conect it. ALL DONE! Sent from my Samsung Galaxy Note 3 using PW Forum app","msabbasi;4338136: Nice DIY. Only thing I'd do differently would be to take a hack saw and cut a slot in the 22mm ring spanner wide enough to allow the wire of the connector to pass rather than damage the grip. Open ring spanners are available: Also crow's foot ring spanner could have been used. On my car the acceleration had dropped considerably so I took the car to Honda Classic and they determined that the cat was chocked badly. They removed the cat, scraped the ""rust"" and blew it out with compressed air. Huge amounts of red smoke came out. They used a special sensor removal tool that did not require the grip to be cut. This resulted in huge improvement in acelleration. very good",,

"The car in discussion here is civic 2006 VTI Oriel. The purpose of this thread is to share the findings and resolution and help others stuck in such situation. Issue: The brake pedal sank on brake application. It was happening whether the car is stationary or moving. It did sink little when the car was shut off (no booster assist). This was dangerous as the car was not stopping properly, and lunged forward even on full brake application even on lower speeds. The abs kicked in randomly on braking, everytime on hard braking (even on slower speeds with medium braking force while the wheels werent even close to locking). Checked brake oil level, it was full. Cheked for leaks, none found in lines, calipers, master cylinder. Flushed and bled the system to no avail. The most obvious cause in this case is Master cylinder itself (having an internal leak and bypassing fluid via cup seals). Without giving it much thought, replaced it with new Honda genuine part. New parts was bench bled and then bled the system again and lo and behold, the pedal is still sinking. Bled again and again, actuating ABS aswell, wasting couple litres of brake fluid (must have cleaned the lines good lol). Doubted that the new master cylinder is faulty aswell. Tested it by blocking the two outlet ports with cutup line ends with ends shut (desi blockers). The pedal was rock solid. Well, put it all back together and back to sinking.

I never knew this had to be done yearly. I think 2 out of my 3 current vehicles have had 'brake service' from 3S within the last 6 months (Honda, Kia), but not sure if they flushed / replaced the brake fluid during this service. Just checked receipts on my log, they haven't charged me the fluid. Now what does that mean and what am I supposed to do now?",,

There are two ports on the ABS hydraulic system block itself, a stick is put in these ports and then the brake is applied on static car. If even one of the stick is pushed out, there is the fault. However, i looked hard at the abs module of civic was unable to find such ports. Otherway is to isolate the system, take out all 4 wheel lines from ABS module and block the ports, leave the 2 lines coming from Master cylinder, if the pedal is still sinking, its the ABS. As I had already ruled out remaining components, decided to procure one and slap it on. Bought one from junk yard for 4k. The catch is it has to be the exact same part. The shopkeepers want to frankenstine it by swapping hydraulic body to existing solenoid acutators (peddling out oddball parts). For PKDM 7th gen civic VTI oriel, the ABS module part code is BA, some other origin has J. Here is how the parts look:",,

Here is the explanation of the issue: ABS unit regulates (open/shut) the brake line pressure as per the wheel sensor input during braking. If the wheel locks up, ABS unit actuates respective wheel solenoid and reroutes the brake fluid pressure to free up the wheel momentarily. While doing so, the pressurised brake fluid has to go somewhere, thats where fluid reservoir comes into play. These reservoirs (2 of them for civic) are built into the hydraulic body of ABS unit and have a spring loaded piston present in them. (picture from youtube video):  When ABS is actuated for a wheel, a return solenoid actuates and releases the pressure to this reservoir. In my case, the solenoid was sticking open and dumping the fluid in reservoir all the time, hence causing sinking pedal. Later on I opened up the old ABS module to find the reservoirs: Notice the two circular holes above actuator valves, these are the reservoirs, opened up one of them, opened one of them up, the piston is stuck inside still but you get the idea:",,

"So this is the Mitsubishi I, a weird quirky 660cc that not people know about..including myself. Even though I own one. Everyday I have atleast one bewildered bike rider that gazes at the front of the car in other disbelief. ""Where is the bonnet"" says his face as he nearly crashes into me, only swerving away at the very last second. The I is a difficult car to own, it's thirsty, only gives around 13 km-l. It's a tad noisy due to the fact the engine in underneath the rear seats and worst of all is the maintenance. If you don't have a mechanic that understands these cars, they'll only make your problem worse. Spare parts are rarer than a period of political harmony in Pakistan. It takes as much oil as a Honda City, it takes more coolant than a Honda Civic X. But there's just something about this car that just causes you to get attached to it. It has a personality, it's different and more exciting than most 660cc hatchbacks. So if anyone here has a Mitsubishi I, leave a comment down below. I'd love to know where you get your maintenance done from, do you have a guy that can source space parts. This cars comes equipped with keyless entry and go but the keyless remote has long been lost. Does anyone know where I might be able to get a new one made, obviously I don't have the original so I can't make a clone.

The moly in the grease actually gets deposited on the metal and provides lubrication even when its pressed out in extreme pressure. You can buy the correct CVJ grease in unbranded packets or in branded 1 kg jars in Pakistan, its not cheap and once is stains your clothes you have to throw them away, no detergent can remove those stains. This is a plain lithium soap grease which would not have a high drop point either, and it says MP, which means its a slap on every time grease - something I would never use even if given for free. Its meant for oldstyle door hinges etc on ancient cars, old style truck water pumps etc. The TDS on their website is very unimpressive, and I personally would never use it in a CVJ",,

Do not overfill the joint, weigh out about 90 grams and use it per side, it may seem low but its enough as the centrifugal force of the spinning axle will cause the grease to roll in the joint - which is exactly what you want. Make sure all traces of old grease are removed first, wash with kerosene petrol mix and dry with acetone for at least 15 minutes before repacking the joint. @rizkhan - if your joint has started to click and the boot it not ripped, remove the joint immediately and fill with correct CVJ grease like this LM product. You can also buy it of other brands, The Fina lube bucket of 5 kg I had was good for years. One car outer joints take 180 grams only for both sides. Please note that you dont want this grease in spider type tripod inner joints because the rollers spin at high speed within the spider bearings and the moly in the grease can separate out and cause dragging. A 1-5% moly content NLGI2 li-complex Exteme pressure grease with adhesive and smooth texture is good for that purpose, Or even no moly content but very impressive loading spec grease will work.",,

Some queries: - How much do I have to pay to customs for a dashcam worth 20k? - What if the item doesn't reach me but it's sent by the seller? - Should I avoid using AliExpress and purchase some other 4K dashcam available in Pakistan on different websites? Which 4k dashcam do you guys recommend?","I updated my Pro through app. Just connect your camera with PC, Laptop and look for updates in app on your phone. Pretty straight forward and easy.",,

But first let me know which car/model you have and its problems. Thanks. Thank you for your reply, let me describe the complete history with the issues in details. The car under discussion is Chevrolet Joy 2007 This was happen back in July 2016 (Ramzan) when I felt serious issues in suspension and I headed towards Korea Motors , Punjab Society, Defense. The mechanic there checked, took test drive and told that its bearings needs to be changed along with shocks. He also said that CHIMTA (don’t know the real/exact name) also needs to be changed and he referred me to their shop located in Montgomery road for buying the required stuff. I got bearings and shocks along with the seals and headed again to mechanic’s work shop, the shocks opted were Kabuli (that was my mistake). The mechanic changed the things and I felt slight difference but I know that he has not done the required work. Later, right after one month August 2016 during raining seasons during my return trip from Islamabad I hear the bearings noise. I got that checked to another mechanic (who is from Chevrolet platinum motors and started his own workshop) and he said that its bearings needs to be changed and along with some suspension checkup. I got the original Japanese bearings from the wholesale dealer in badami bagh Lahore and headed to mechanic for replacement. When he opened the hubs she showed me that CHIMTA needs to be replaced or can be repaired since it was never repaired before. I asked him to check everything and let me know the required work upon which the following items were repaired. Shocks were repaired (as the Kabuli ones I bought was already repaired before) End was repaired Chimta was repaired Bearings were changed Now since that repaired I think was my mistake to get the things repaired, though the lath man (kharadia) told me that you will not face issues and the car run till it has already done e.g. for next 100k KMs. I was satisfied and enjoying as the noises was reduced car used to be smooth on bumpy road. But, right after two months the issues rises again, I was like WTF….. so this is the history… The car bounces a lot on bumpy roads, the car hits from back with thak sound when crossing speed breaker. I can feel the vibration in steering while driving on bumpy road like bumps are directly hitting the car body… I need a honest and good mechanic and this I will be replacing each and every part with new either GM manufactured or Korean…",,

Also there is blue smoke as well. Any experts can humbly guide me what should be done. Many thanks!",Is Rehman Autos located on IJP Road?,,

"AoA PWers, I hope you guys are well. I have been a german car fan mostly, however, on a whim, I acquired this Vauxhall Astra Twintop as a project to restore during the winter months, where afternoons, evenings are dark and depressing and you can not do much outside. A bit of background on the car: The Car on the whole: The car is a 2008 model in the Design trim. It is a twintop body type, which is Vauxhall's jargon for a hard-top convertible coupe. The car is attractive to look at, and, being a hard top convertible, it is very practical and usable in the British weather all year round. The car is compact in size, owing to the cleverly designed 3 pc folding roof, you really don't need a big boot to accommodate the folded roof when you have the top down. The weight of the roof in the boot along with the strut braces add weight to the rear end while adding rigidity to the chassis, once the roof is down. Being the not so basic model, I found that there's decent amount of kit added as standard on the car. I will discuss features and options in more detail further along in the post. The Engine & Transmission: The car has a 1.8L 4 Cylinder 16v petrol engine that produces 138 Bhp and 175 nm of torque. Official 0-60mph time is 10.7 seconds. The engine is rather punchy and can keep up with motorway traffic (70 mph) while it returns decent fuel economy (14 km/l local and 17.5 km/l on the motorway with AC). The transmission is a 5 speed manual transmission with a reverse gear on the opposite side ( Like most GM cars I suppose, Daewoo racer in Pakistan had that kind of a shifter layout) Interior: The interior is well kitted out with comfortable half leather seats with height adjustment and lumbar support, MP3 / Aux enabled audio with a monochrome display. Push start with Key-less entry. The cabin is a mix of leather and piano black plastic with silver accents. Steering wheel controls for audio and the on-board computer. There's decent legroom given the size of the car both on the front and rear. a 6ft tall adult can comfortably be accommodated in the rear seat with the front seats less than half way forward. There are powered mirrors for both front and rears and the wing mirrors are powered and heated. It has automatic lights and wipers on the front. However I do miss the rear wiper which is not there as the rear screen obviously needs to fold with the roof. The car does not have Cruise Control, however it is a very easy retrofit and a quick upgrade, in the case of my car, just a matter of replacing the indicator stalk and enabling Cruise control on the ECU. The wind breaker was an optional extra offered by Vauxhall and is not included on this car. Hence, wind makes it slightly difficult to drive at high speeds with the roof down. Exterior The exterior is finished in Star Silver metalic with matching bumpers, door handles and wing mirrors. 17 inch alloy wheels with relatively low profile tyres mean that the car sits on the road very nicely and handles very well. Fog lamps are standard on the front and rear of the car. There's chrome trim on the front grill and the boot lid that compliments the car very nicely and a 3rd brake lamp (LED) is mounted on the boot lid as well. A chrome exhaust tip is a nice looking addition to the rear of the car.","The To-Fix List so far: New Battery - Installed Coolant level sensor to be replaced as it raises a false alarm. Full Service (Oil, Filters, Plugs). Wing mirror cover replacement on the Driver's side. Upgrade low beam bulbs to brighter ones. Horn does not work. This is a common fault on these where the control interface module goes funny. However, in my case, I think the module is okay and it is either the fuse or the horn itself that has packed up. Minor Scratches and scuffs on the body will be sorted ( It is an old car after all) Upgrades that i have planed for: I am looking to restore / improve the car keeping it OEM+. Here is what i have planned so far OEM Cruise Control retrofit OEM Satnav retrofit 18"" Alloy wheel upgrade with OEM Vauxhall Twintop wheels. Upgraded High Strength rear braces - Already installed as the previous owner was able to bend the rear brace on one side. Roof folding mechanism upgrades- replacing plastic cogs with copper ones. If i am able to find a complete interior / dash panels, I may upgrade the interior with heated full leather seats.",,

"i want all Pak Wheelers to inform dem about serious draw backs by direct connection of radiator fan in ur ride Direct Connection of the Radiator Fan In PAKISTAN most of the cars have this problem that their radiator fan starts directly when the car is started regardless of the water temperature in the radiator, because the fan (electrically driven) circuit is by passed from the thermostat switch. Well our mechanics do this because they think that by keeping the water temperature (indicated at the control panel by temperature gauge) to the minimum possible level will help engine perform well. Actually the normal operating temperature of the engine, referred with respect to the water temperature in the radiator is 82 ± 3 °C. It is important to note that the water in the radiator boils at 115 to 120 °C .The radiator cap keeps the water under pressure and that is why the water boils above the its normal boiling point. The calibration of the gauge starts from 50°C .So the total range on the dial of the gauge is from 50°C to 120°C. So when needle reaches the middle of the gauge, engine is actually at its NORMAL WORKING TEMPERATURE {average temp of the gauge (as averages fall in the middle) is (115+50)/2=82.5 °C}. So at the normal working temperature the needle should be somewhere in the middle of the gauge. Whereas our so-called skilled mechanics interpret this as over-heating of the engine.THIS IS TOTALLY WRONG! In a moment I will be listing the disadvantages of having your radiator fan direct .But first I would like to tell the readers about the cooling system of the engine in brief . In water circuit of the engine (water circuit means the path of the water in engine) the effort is made to keep the water away from radiator till the water temperature in the water jacket reaches the 82°C mark. Simply you can say that water is not allowed to go in the radiator and is made to circulate inside the water jacket. This is done by using a device called THERMOSTAT VALVE. This thermostat valve when closed does not allow the water to circulate in the radiator. As soon as the temperature starts to go beyond 78°C the valve opens. This allows the water to be circulated in the radiator. If the heat dissipation of the radiator cannot keep the temperature at about 82°C the THERMOSTAT SWITCH completes the circuit of the electrically driven radiator fan to keep the temperature at 82°C by circulating air. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE that if temperature goes beyond 82°C it is comparatively acceptable as the most likely disadvantage is the increased potential of the engine to knock at higher gear and low engine rpm . But if the temperature is less than the normal operating temperature then it will cause not only the deterioration of the engine performance but also shortening your engine life. So in most of the cars the thermostat valve is removed, making the water circuit complete all the times and also bypassing the thermostat switch to keep fan running with engine regardless of engine temperature . The problems that can arise as a result are discussed below: Problems associated with Carburetion Mixture Preparation The petrol air/mixture preparation in the carburetor is a temperature dependent function. To keep the mixture preparation efficiency maximum the water in the radiator and water jacket is fed to the outer walls (around venturi) of the carburetor to keep it warm. This increase of the temperature helps to mix up the petrol/air. If the temperature of the water is not at optimum, the petrol air mixture preparation in the carburetor will be effected .This will cause the engine to run on non-homogeneous mixture causing engine to misfire and vibrant engine operation is resulted. One must have noticed the vibrant engine operation on cold starting in the morning. This is also due to the same reason as engine temperature is very low and mixture preparation is not good. So by keeping the fan direct you are going make the engine run with vibrations and it will not deliver its full power as the mixture (petrol/air) is not homogeneous (well prepared) . Mixture Distribution If the temperature of the radiator water is kept low then the carburetor temperature also keeps low as the water circulates around the carburetor venturi (the cylindrical passage down the carburetor where air/petrol gets mixed) .The optimum carburetor operation is achieved at higher temperature. So by keeping the fan direct temperature is kept around 55 to 60 °C. This not only effects the mixture preparation but also the mixture movement as well. The mixture is prepared in carburetor and burnt in the cylinder. To get to cylinder the petrol/air passes through carburetor venturi and inlet manifold. If the temperature of venturi and manifold is low then the condensation of the petrol takes place. This will also cause the engine to run on non-homogeneous mixture and the engine running results will be the same as discussed in the above case . It is important to note that if the mixture fed to the cylinder is not homogeneous then the combustion will not produced the desired amount of power .By meaning the homogeneous mixture it is assumed that the mixture strength expressed by weight ratios is same through out the mixture volume .The combustion is so fast that in non homogeneous mixture the petrol will not burn in the areas where not enough air is not present .This results in loss of fuel and engine produces less power .So by keeping your fan direct you will actually be doing the same thing as discussed above as water temperature will be low. Problems associated with Engine Four Stroke Cycle As the engine temperature is not measured directly but is measured with respect to water temperature in the radiator so when the temperature of the radiator water reaches somewhere around 115 to 120°C, the temp. of the engine is enough to cause serious engine damage and it can even result in ceasing the engine . The point here which I would like to emphasize is that engine temperature is never measured directly but the water temperature is measured. So if water temperature is low so is the engine temperature.The discussion to follow will be carried taking the radiator water temperature as reference. When engine is started the temperature at the piston top or piston temperature is very low, same as atmospheric temperature. During engine operation it reaches hundred of degrees centigrade. No metal or alloy is developed yet which has zero expansion rate. So to accommodate the expansion the piston is made oval shaped. At cold starting the piston does not completely seal the cylinder, but as temperature rises the piston expands and seals the gap. At water temperatures above 115 to 120 °C the expansion is so great that the piston gets stuck resulting in serious engine damage. Below temperatures of say 75°C the piston is loosely fit in the cylinder. We will discuss engine condition keeping in mind that water temperature as it is less than 75°C as fan is made to operate directly preventing the engine to operate at its normal working temperature. Intake stroke When the normal operating temperature of the engine is not achieved then the piston is not complete fit in the cylinder. During intake stroke piston descends from TDC(top dead center) and reaches BDC (bottom dead center). So if the piston is not completely fit than the petrol/air will not be sucked in properly. This will result in low engine volumetric efficiency Compression Stroke During compression stroke piston reaches from BDCto TDC. If the temperature of the piston is below normal then it will not fit the cylinder. So the petrol air sucked in prior ot compression, when compressed during compression stroke will bypass the piston and piston rings into the crankcase (It will be discussed in detail later on). So full compression is not achieved and this results in lower engine output and higher fuel consumption . Power Stroke During power stoke the rapidly expanding gases pushes the piston down giving power. If the piston does not fit completely then the expanding gases will by pass the piston rings thus resulting in incomplete power transfer making the engine H.P to decrease and fuel consumption to increase . Exhaust Stroke During exhaust stroke if piston is not complete fit then the exhaust will not be good. The exhaust air will by pass the piston, rings and will reach the crankcase causing oil fouling (it will also be discussed in detail later on) . Engine Oil Fouling (a) If the engine is made to run on low temp than optimum then the compression stroke is not fully efficient. The petrol/air mixture instead of being compressed, by passes the piston and piston rings. On its way to crankcase it passes the cylinder wall. The cylinder walls are soaked with engine oil to lubricate piton and rings. So when petrol by passes the piston rings it mixes with the oil on the cylinder walls. Petrol being excellent organic solvent dissolves and dilutes the engine oil, promoting engine wear . (b) During power and exhaust stroke the burnt gases which are normally non metallic oxides (acidic in nature) bypass the piston rings and enter the crankcase. Here these gases mix with the water vapors. This forms acidic compounds that get mixed with engine oil resulting in altering the oil PH. It makes the engine oil acidic and corrosion always takes speeds up in the acidic medium. For this reason the engine oils are made buffers (which can retain there PH although some amount of acid is added to them). But they can retain there PH only if a small amount of acid is added. So if engine is run consistently on low temperature then it will promote engine wear as engine oil will get acidic . (c) The unburnt particles from the combustion chamber also by pass the piston as they are very small in size. When they enter the crankcase they get mixed with the oil. The engine oil are made detergents. That is they can accumulate small amount of these particles and hold them in suspension or you can say dissolve them. But this tendency is limited to a small amount. If prolonged use of engine at low temperature is carried out then it will cause pre mature engine wear. As these particles do not completely dissolve in oil, they narrow down the small channels in engine lubrication circuit. This effects the engine lubrication as proper amount of oil is not fed to the moving parts resulting in engine wear. Summarizing The Above Discussion The following are the problems summarized keeping in mind that if engine is not running on its normal working temperature. (1) It will decrease the air/petrol mixing efficiency . (2) It will effect the distribution of petrol/air mixture to each cylinder. (3) This will decrease the volumetric efficiency of the engine resulting in increased fuel consumption . (4) The engine oil will get fouled prematurely resulting in more oil changes . (5) The fouled engine oil will result in the premature engine wear shortening the engine life. (6) Vibrant and rough idle (low speed running). (7) Engine will never give its full power and torque . (8) It will increase the fuel consumption without increasing the output of the engine . Rear wheel Drive Cars In rare wheel drive cars the radiator fan is not electrically driven but it is belt driven. It starts running as soon as the engine is started. To keep the engine temperature at optimum level the water is not allowed to circulate (when cold) in the radiator as the THERMOSTAT VALVE remains closed. As soon as the temperature starts to rise the valve is opened and the belt driven fan keeps the air circulating making the water temperature stick to an optimum level. So in rear wheel drive cars the Thermostat valve should NEVER BE REMOVED.

"i want all Pak Wheelers to inform dem about serious draw backs by direct connection of radiator fan in ur ride Direct Connection of the Radiator Fan In PAKISTAN most of the cars have this problem that their radiator fan starts directly when the car is started regardless of the water temperature in the radiator, because the fan (electrically driven) circuit is by passed from the thermostat switch. Well our mechanics do this because they think that by keeping the water temperature (indicated at the control panel by temperature gauge) to the minimum possible level will help engine perform well. Actually the normal operating temperature of the engine, referred with respect to the water temperature in the radiator is 82 ± 3 °C. It is important to note that the water in the radiator boils at 115 to 120 °C .The radiator cap keeps the water under pressure and that is why the water boils above the its normal boiling point. The calibration of the gauge starts from 50°C .So the total range on the dial of the gauge is from 50°C to 120°C. So when needle reaches the middle of the gauge, engine is actually at its NORMAL WORKING TEMPERATURE {average temp of the gauge (as averages fall in the middle) is (115+50)/2=82.5 °C}. So at the normal working temperature the needle should be somewhere in the middle of the gauge. Whereas our so-called skilled mechanics interpret this as over-heating of the engine.THIS IS TOTALLY WRONG! In a moment I will be listing the disadvantages of having your radiator fan direct .But first I would like to tell the readers about the cooling system of the engine in brief . In water circuit of the engine (water circuit means the path of the water in engine) the effort is made to keep the water away from radiator till the water temperature in the water jacket reaches the 82°C mark. Simply you can say that water is not allowed to go in the radiator and is made to circulate inside the water jacket. This is done by using a device called THERMOSTAT VALVE. This thermostat valve when closed does not allow the water to circulate in the radiator. As soon as the temperature starts to go beyond 78°C the valve opens. This allows the water to be circulated in the radiator. If the heat dissipation of the radiator cannot keep the temperature at about 82°C the THERMOSTAT SWITCH completes the circuit of the electrically driven radiator fan to keep the temperature at 82°C by circulating air. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE that if temperature goes beyond 82°C it is comparatively acceptable as the most likely disadvantage is the increased potential of the engine to knock at higher gear and low engine rpm . But if the temperature is less than the normal operating temperature then it will cause not only the deterioration of the engine performance but also shortening your engine life. So in most of the cars the thermostat valve is removed, making the water circuit complete all the times and also bypassing the thermostat switch to keep fan running with engine regardless of engine temperature . The problems that can arise as a result are discussed below: Problems associated with Carburetion Mixture Preparation The petrol air/mixture preparation in the carburetor is a temperature dependent function. To keep the mixture preparation efficiency maximum the water in the radiator and water jacket is fed to the outer walls (around venturi) of the carburetor to keep it warm. This increase of the temperature helps to mix up the petrol/air. If the temperature of the water is not at optimum, the petrol air mixture preparation in the carburetor will be effected .This will cause the engine to run on non-homogeneous mixture causing engine to misfire and vibrant engine operation is resulted. One must have noticed the vibrant engine operation on cold starting in the morning. This is also due to the same reason as engine temperature is very low and mixture preparation is not good. So by keeping the fan direct you are going make the engine run with vibrations and it will not deliver its full power as the mixture (petrol/air) is not homogeneous (well prepared) . Mixture Distribution If the temperature of the radiator water is kept low then the carburetor temperature also keeps low as the water circulates around the carburetor venturi (the cylindrical passage down the carburetor where air/petrol gets mixed) .The optimum carburetor operation is achieved at higher temperature. So by keeping the fan direct temperature is kept around 55 to 60 °C. This not only effects the mixture preparation but also the mixture movement as well. The mixture is prepared in carburetor and burnt in the cylinder. To get to cylinder the petrol/air passes through carburetor venturi and inlet manifold. If the temperature of venturi and manifold is low then the condensation of the petrol takes place. This will also cause the engine to run on non-homogeneous mixture and the engine running results will be the same as discussed in the above case . It is important to note that if the mixture fed to the cylinder is not homogeneous then the combustion will not produced the desired amount of power .By meaning the homogeneous mixture it is assumed that the mixture strength expressed by weight ratios is same through out the mixture volume .The combustion is so fast that in non homogeneous mixture the petrol will not burn in the areas where not enough air is not present .This results in loss of fuel and engine produces less power .So by keeping your fan direct you will actually be doing the same thing as discussed above as water temperature will be low. Problems associated with Engine Four Stroke Cycle As the engine temperature is not measured directly but is measured with respect to water temperature in the radiator so when the temperature of the radiator water reaches somewhere around 115 to 120°C, the temp. of the engine is enough to cause serious engine damage and it can even result in ceasing the engine . The point here which I would like to emphasize is that engine temperature is never measured directly but the water temperature is measured. So if water temperature is low so is the engine temperature.The discussion to follow will be carried taking the radiator water temperature as reference. When engine is started the temperature at the piston top or piston temperature is very low, same as atmospheric temperature. During engine operation it reaches hundred of degrees centigrade. No metal or alloy is developed yet which has zero expansion rate. So to accommodate the expansion the piston is made oval shaped. At cold starting the piston does not completely seal the cylinder, but as temperature rises the piston expands and seals the gap. At water temperatures above 115 to 120 °C the expansion is so great that the piston gets stuck resulting in serious engine damage. Below temperatures of say 75°C the piston is loosely fit in the cylinder. We will discuss engine condition keeping in mind that water temperature as it is less than 75°C as fan is made to operate directly preventing the engine to operate at its normal working temperature. Intake stroke When the normal operating temperature of the engine is not achieved then the piston is not complete fit in the cylinder. During intake stroke piston descends from TDC(top dead center) and reaches BDC (bottom dead center). So if the piston is not completely fit than the petrol/air will not be sucked in properly. This will result in low engine volumetric efficiency Compression Stroke During compression stroke piston reaches from BDCto TDC. If the temperature of the piston is below normal then it will not fit the cylinder. So the petrol air sucked in prior ot compression, when compressed during compression stroke will bypass the piston and piston rings into the crankcase (It will be discussed in detail later on). So full compression is not achieved and this results in lower engine output and higher fuel consumption . Power Stroke During power stoke the rapidly expanding gases pushes the piston down giving power. If the piston does not fit completely then the expanding gases will by pass the piston rings thus resulting in incomplete power transfer making the engine H.P to decrease and fuel consumption to increase . Exhaust Stroke During exhaust stroke if piston is not complete fit then the exhaust will not be good. The exhaust air will by pass the piston, rings and will reach the crankcase causing oil fouling (it will also be discussed in detail later on) . Engine Oil Fouling (a) If the engine is made to run on low temp than optimum then the compression stroke is not fully efficient. The petrol/air mixture instead of being compressed, by passes the piston and piston rings. On its way to crankcase it passes the cylinder wall. The cylinder walls are soaked with engine oil to lubricate piton and rings. So when petrol by passes the piston rings it mixes with the oil on the cylinder walls. Petrol being excellent organic solvent dissolves and dilutes the engine oil, promoting engine wear . (b) During power and exhaust stroke the burnt gases which are normally non metallic oxides (acidic in nature) bypass the piston rings and enter the crankcase. Here these gases mix with the water vapors. This forms acidic compounds that get mixed with engine oil resulting in altering the oil PH. It makes the engine oil acidic and corrosion always takes speeds up in the acidic medium. For this reason the engine oils are made buffers (which can retain there PH although some amount of acid is added to them). But they can retain there PH only if a small amount of acid is added. So if engine is run consistently on low temperature then it will promote engine wear as engine oil will get acidic . (c) The unburnt particles from the combustion chamber also by pass the piston as they are very small in size. When they enter the crankcase they get mixed with the oil. The engine oil are made detergents. That is they can accumulate small amount of these particles and hold them in suspension or you can say dissolve them. But this tendency is limited to a small amount. If prolonged use of engine at low temperature is carried out then it will cause pre mature engine wear. As these particles do not completely dissolve in oil, they narrow down the small channels in engine lubrication circuit. This effects the engine lubrication as proper amount of oil is not fed to the moving parts resulting in engine wear. Summarizing The Above Discussion The following are the problems summarized keeping in mind that if engine is not running on its normal working temperature. (1) It will decrease the air/petrol mixing efficiency . (2) It will effect the distribution of petrol/air mixture to each cylinder. (3) This will decrease the volumetric efficiency of the engine resulting in increased fuel consumption . (4) The engine oil will get fouled prematurely resulting in more oil changes . (5) The fouled engine oil will result in the premature engine wear shortening the engine life. (6) Vibrant and rough idle (low speed running). (7) Engine will never give its full power and torque . (8) It will increase the fuel consumption without increasing the output of the engine . Rear wheel Drive Cars In rare wheel drive cars the radiator fan is not electrically driven but it is belt driven. It starts running as soon as the engine is started. To keep the engine temperature at optimum level the water is not allowed to circulate (when cold) in the radiator as the THERMOSTAT VALVE remains closed. As soon as the temperature starts to rise the valve is opened and the belt driven fan keeps the air circulating making the water temperature stick to an optimum level. So in rear wheel drive cars the Thermostat valve should NEVER BE REMOVED. As it will result in the same problems as discussed above (by removing thermostat valve and making fan direct in front wheel cars) .

"Assalam-o-Alaikum. Hi everyone, I have a Honda Accord (H) of the 88 model, and I am looking to replace the engine. I need suggestions regarding a fuel-efficient and powerful engine for my car. Currently, it is in its original condition with the stock engine, which is a CNG 1.6cc 12 valve A16A engine.","rohaansaeed;3282953: Here is how it sits in the 3rd Generation Accord engine bay These pictures are off the net for reference purposes. There is only one of these engines in Shershah and its partially damaged (broken tappet cover, missing lifters, missing distributor, missing cam sensor etc. I had the original PH4 ECU for this engine at my home in Karachi along with the original gearbox, original exhaust muffler for this engine (it was an SS item). Sold them off last year. It is very very rare to find this engine,in Pakistan. The scrappie whom I bought this engine from bought these engines by accident thinking they were the van B20. There were two of these engines, one complete to the last plug (including vacuum forest box) and one broken, The complete one was sold off. Your best option would be to find the twin carb B18 engine for this car. There used to be quite a few of them in shershah.",,

Currently the car is with a relative and the car is running great MashAllah. B18 will be a very good choice as well, A20A3 and A20A4 aren't bad either, but yeah again, depends upon availability The prelude B20 cants backwards like the F and H series engines, this type B20 was only installed in this model year accord and its immediate cousin prelude. Thats why its so damn rare. The 91 prelude is completely different. I have driven an accord with this engine - its love I tell you, solid torque that can spin wheels like mad - while making sure the engine roar note never gets too rough. But the exhaust box (original one) makes it sound like a much bigger engine at high rpm - The car behind you can hear the exhaust note, but you cannot.",,

I never had a chance to experience the B20 with the original exhaust as mine was a swap and the exhaust was better suited for the A16, so yeah I grabbed a Toyota Chaser exhaust and enjoyed driving with that on, it had a distinct roar in the mid range RPM's as well Really good engine in my opinion, loved it on long routes and the car felt great with it compared to the clumsy A16. This model accord does not have a transmission mount, the engine bears on 3 mounts, for weight and 2 for torque twisting. The 3 are: timing side, front and back on the subframes, the torque twisting ones are the one long dogbone at the top of the engine and one small rectangle piece under the transmission. Its sister prelude is incredibly rare in Pakistan, I know of one only in Quetta, the Integras share the civic platform and utilise completely different mounting points.",,

Give priority to the B20A engine as it's bolt on. It's PGM-Fi so make sure you get the complete setup (uncut wiring and ECU included). This engine came in the JDM Accords, Preludes and Vigors Never gave me any trouble, car always ran smooth as silk and it's a LOT better option compared to the A-series There were two variants, one is the Black top and one is the Golden top, you're more likely to find the Black top over here, both have an output of a very decent 160hp. You can even give consideration to the B18 series. Whatever you do, stick to the B-series. Do NOT swap the D15 as it will disrupt the weight distribution of the car. B20A and B18's are mostly PGM-Fi so yes you'll be switching from Carby to PGM-Fi, more fuel efficiency and more power. Oh and PGM-Fi stands for Programmed Fuel Injection",,

"Hello & Salam to All PakWheelers! I own a Cultus and currently I have removed the CNG Cylendir from the Trunk because shortage and long lines of CNG and to add some space for luggage. I put the stock speakers and parcel board back in the car. Before that i was using a chipboard 0.75"" speaker board aka phatta with a pair of 6x9 and they were doing the job. Now the stock speakers sound very pathetic as compared to the ones I have before. Now suggest me ideas for getting better audio quality without sacrificing on trunk space. One idea i have in my mind is making adding two pairs of speakers at some moveable sealed MDF cubic box which work just like the stock fiber board, by using some kind of angel iron brackets and base so the weight can be beared. The second thought which is being used by many Cultus owners, put a pair of 6x9 speakers on the stock fiber board. Is it a good idea to add the speakers directly on the stock parcel tray? will it bear the constant weight of speakers around 5kg or more. Along with this 1 pair, how about adding another pair for front underseat speakers, by either using ready made or either using custom made. Have any one tried underseat speakers in Cultus.

"Asslam u alaikum brothers, I am already posting in one more forum regarding my 1974 PROJECT KE35. i m literally in do or die situation at the moment coz my mechanic told me to go for beams 3sge engine in my 1974 corolla, it's 2.0 L with 6fwd speed. It was in October 2015, but since then till now more then 1.5years he failed to start my car and my car is in stationary position since that long time. I have met one person today his name is umer and he had a v v v v v bad experience in beams while he was trying to fit that engine in RX8. As he shared all his bad experiences with me related to beams and in the end he spent more then 2 lacs just on engine electrician works and he failed to run that engine properly coz of his unadjustable missing air intake sensor. (Which is missing in my engine too) and there is no such single beams in Pakistan who is working properly with dual vvti cos our mechanics n electricians are totally shit and they don't even know how to run n start this engine properly and these people already made my life miserable. As my car is kind of unique, it's 2 door coupe 1974 looks like 1976 corolla. And he advised me to get rid of this engine n go for 3SFE engine which is use to be in RAV4 n many other Toyota models like MR2. And is much more easy to use and will fit on the same foundation of beams engine, even I don't need to change my gear assembly. So plz I m looking for good advice, especially from some experienced n professional members on this pakwheels forum who can help me out and advise me shall I go for 3SFE engine with gear assembly of beams or should I change the both or shall I stick with beams. Which is most beneficial for me? It will be really kind of u guys if u can take me out of this madness U can help me out while replying in this forum, leaving me a text msg ( with ur name n ref of pakwheels forums) or just call me.

Can any battery expert here tell me how long AGS battery last? What are the key points to extend the life of battery Thanks All Click here for SOLUTION254,"when I had my workshop in Karachi, I prepped batteries myself. Every single one worked strong as an ox and would crank the engine like it was a childs toy. It didnt lose charge overnight either. Customers had the same batteries for 4 to 5 or more years in Karachi - in all sorts of cars. I charged more than a regular shop as the acid I bought had to be purchased personally - while distilled water was supplied to me for very little surcharge over its actual price. The results were spectacular. I usually maintained the SG between 1.26 to 1.28 - checked with scales not a hydrometer. You also need to protect the batteries from heat - so make sure you have some insulation or heatshield to protect from the brunt of heat. Also make sure your battery terminals are of excellent quality, not those screw press sheet metal trash you see in almost every other car in Pakistan.",,

Alternator (It seems to be doing when there is electrical load, i.e. headlights AC on) but not sure, as happened without it too once. 3. ECU is malfunctioning Btw, will Honda HDS be able to read more DTCs? as currently generic scanner is being used. Any good in taking it to honda? Dont want it to be destroyed at the hands of street side ""lektrishuns"". Your help is highly appreciated. @capsat @Xulfiqar @SER_GTR",You may have to import from UK as same ecu was there in UK Civic,,

"@xulfiqar I did... Xulfiqar;4235646: Now go buy a leppon filter and cut it open, you will have your quality test. I am not impressed. For Toyota users, genuine Thai made filters are better alternative if you cannot opt for Japan made filters. I should probably give it benefit of the doubt as I have no idea how a genuine LePPON can be differentiated from a fake LePPON. I took it apart to see if it is good quality as in 200 Rupee range, it is cheap compared to Genuine Toyota filters of Thai origin (400 Rupees) or Japan origin (800/850 Rupees). If I had found the quality good enough, I would opt for it in future since it is cheap but I think we can get a good conclusion about filters, if it is cheap, it missing something i.e. cheap filter media/no proper pressure plate/no proper relief valve/cheap anti-drain back valve. This is not only true with LePPON but even between Toyota's Thai and Japan made filters. I know there are fakes available in the market of Toyota as well but we do know reliable part shops and have got reference of original to compare them with. (You can simply shine a light in the filter hole before purchase and confirm the filter media colour, valve's presence etc.) I will be taking the Toyota filters apart as well, not new though since they are expensive. I don't think there is any need since I have already posted photos of genuine filters taken apart from another site but just to confirm, that the filters sold here have got the same mechanism inside as the originals shown in the other topic. The pictures speak for themselves. I may be wrong about pointing some parts of the filter. Please keep the discussion healthy. Visual exterior comparison  Visual exterior comparison  I hate insects and they creep me out, no shame in admitting it. For a moment my heart was racing when I saw this inside the LePPON filter because it looked like an insect...  and it begins  A spring that pushes against the filter cartridge, no idea what the purpose is. Then it is the filter element. The empty shell. Anti-drain back valve/cheap rubber feel. The bottom which connects inside the vehicle.  Close up of the empty shell  Close up of the anti-drain back valve sitting on the holes.  Close up of the inner part with anti-drain back valve removed.  The part which connects with vehicle. Rubber seal/ring removed.  Close up of the rubber valve/seals, cheap?  This is how it sits in the filter cartridge. @xulfiqar , please explain this to me. The spring is used instead of a pressure plate? and that small dot under the spring can actually be pressed inside. This is supposed to be the relief valve? Close up coming in the end. What are cons of the filter set like this???  Close up view from several angles of the filter element. I am honestly not sure whether it was my brute force while putting it inside the pipe wrench, which distorted the filter i.e. not straight or this is how a cheap filter comes? Since the housing was bending after I reached the half point with saw.  Size of the empty filter housing in comparison to the filter element. It is TINY!  I couldn't wait to use the digital caliper which I purchased recently. Genuine Toyota Thai made filter cartridge height is 54 mm!! You need MORE filter area, more = better!  There's that creepy thing again inside filter... which turned out to be glue!!!  MORE PHOTOS IN SECOND POST","the filter media is half the required area, the bypass valve is not all impressive, it relies on a ball to seal against a stamped sheet metal cap. thats like trying to seal a pipe a rusty plate. The antidrainback also looks like its not able to withstand high temperature. As I said before, OE filters are the best way to go. leppon, pokemon, chinchao filters etc look like filters but usually are not.",,

MORE PHOTOS IN SECOND POST","mianaasim;4255757: With all due respect I disagree with some of the conclusions derived: More filter media does NOT mean the oil stays cleaner longer....it is the quality of paper material. Was there a material analysis done to determine if filter paper used is an appropriate one or upto the mark?? Second thing which could have determined the quality is a flow analysis...how much dirt is actually being filtered over a given amount of time at given pressure/temperature. Dont want to drag the discussion to the fact that if all the filter other than japanese are rubbish then we'd be seeing thousands of engines dying every year because of the bad oil filters...and turning whole country into junk yard. There are few things on which filter performance is dependent. These includes oil viscosity, oil temperature, oil pressure and oil flow rate. Taking apart a new oil filter can present some findings but not conclusions. So, if we want to study something we will have to do: 1- Material Analysis 2- Flow Analysis 3- Comparitive Analysis - Take apart Leppon, Guard, Japs, Thai filters after use in same type of engine with same type of engine oil in same conditions after same mileage. This is my opinion, no offense to any1 or any brand. Just a fruit for thought. Thanx. First step to analyse a filter is that you actually measure the medial sq cm and inspect the construction. In this case we see that the manufacturer was a little shy in packing the media in place - The filtration test is done at a whole level and a controlled amount of ""contaminant"" is injected into the oil and the filter run. Usually if the surface area of the media is short and the filter is low cost to purchase one can easily deduce that the filter wont be upto its job - unless its being manufactured by United Nations. I have run into some filters that actually were simply flushing oil in bypass - because the valves were so poorly made they lifted with 10 psi pressure -normal oil pressure in an engine at idle is about 14 psi at minimum. If you remember the old K series toyota engine with upside down oil filters - It was mandatory to use a genuine item unless you liked to hear the crank rattle. The antidrainback valve should seal tight and prevent the big 600 ml oil filter from emptying out while parked. We all have seen a lot of those engines fail in Pakistan. (Blame = aail 2 no. hai meray bhai - no matter if the filter was literally an unmarked item with no brand whatsoever) I once posted a fiiter media here that was cotton waste + twigs + dead bugs + saw dust. Those are used in old mercedes benz diesel engines and do a remarkable job of cleaning up the oil because the only thing you replace in that engine is literally the filter media, the antidrain back and bypass are in the engine. anyway - long n short is that you get what you pay for. and such paper media does not work beyond approx 5000 kms of service, it will eventually start to tear up. If you want long life from an engine use proper filters and change at correct interval.",,

"Hello, audio enthusiasts! Currently, my Cultus has this cheap China touchscreen head unit installed, which rarely gets the job done because its touch is unresponsive, and Bluetooth connectivity is also a hassle.

Please suggest what head unit and set of speakers I should consider purchasing in my budget of (20k).

Problem is, a lot of the older shops that a few years back were selling good quality audio equipment have moved to selling copies/fakes etc etc. Chinese products have flooded the market for a while now. FOCAL was a bit hit. Sehgal was selling focal comps which were a knockoff but any second person who hasn't put in the research will think they're getting a great deal because the shop guy will tell them these are French big brand speakers when in reality, almost all the big name brands have their entry level speakers being manufactured in China under their regulations and standards Morel, Helix (AF), Focal are a few known names which make products that cost thousands of USDs but their entry level speakers and amps are made in China (maximo, maximus, auditor, access, B,F etc etc) The Chinese knockoff will probably be made in the factory next door over there, and they'll pass for the real deal unless you have a keen eye",,

"It was Feb 2018 (when I was almost done restoring my 1963 bug) that someone told me that there is a 1961 VW Bug (Totally Rusted/gutted) near Rawal Town in Islamabad and the owner is even willing to sell it to a Kabaria as many potential buyers had rejected the car. Having restored a 63 Bug as a test case i was really confident that we can restore any bug in Pakistan provided we have correct panels available and a right body work ustad. Having worked with Mr Safdar from Pir wadhai i was really confident that if i provide him correct panels he can do any grafting work. So i decided to contact the seller and bought the bug for PKR 70,000, he was more than willing to help me relocate the car as he wanted to get rid of it ASAP. Here comes Nasir Shaikh bhai to my rescue and offered me his storage for safely parking the car till i plan on starting the restoration, i cant thank him more for all his valuable suggestions and insights. Initially i wanted to just restore it to its formal glory but with the passage of time I realized that it will need alooooooooooooot of work and body panels to correctly restore it because the whole front end was rusted to core, rain gutters were gutted with holes in it, both doors were rusted and nothing was left in them, whole rear apron was deshaped and rusted. Keeping in mind the current situation i decided to experiment with the car and decided to graft in an oval rear window and make it an Oval window Bug . As i started searching regarding differences between a 58-64 Bug and an Oval i came to know that it not just the rear window that was changed in 1958-1964 but many other small changes. Changes which were made on a bugs in 1958-1964 were, Front Window was increased in size by 17%, Rear window was changed from Oval to a bigger version, Trunk Liner area was redesigned, Wiper Assembly was changed, Icepick handles were changed to push button style in 1960, as my bug was 1961 so I needed those as well, Whole front end was redesigned with a new fuel tank and brake fluid reservoir area. Front Hood hinges were changed along with lifting mechanism (Springs were installed in 1958), Front apron was changed from 4 fins to 3 fins, Rear Apron was changed from H pattern to no pattern, Dashboard was changed, These above mentioned changes are just the visual changes not to mention the mechanic changes (which were of no concern to me as i want my bug to just visually look like an Oval).

As i started searching regarding differences between a 58-64 Bug and an Oval i came to know that it not just the rear window that was changed in 1958-1964 but many other small changes. Changes which were made on a bugs in 1958-1964 were, Front Window was increased in size by 17%, Rear window was changed from Oval to a bigger version, Trunk Liner area was redesigned, Wiper Assembly was changed, Icepick handles were changed to push button style in 1960, as my bug was 1961 so I needed those as well, Whole front end was redesigned with a new fuel tank and brake fluid reservoir area. Front Hood hinges were changed along with lifting mechanism (Springs were installed in 1958), Front apron was changed from 4 fins to 3 fins, Rear Apron was changed from H pattern to no pattern, Dashboard was changed, These above mentioned changes are just the visual changes not to mention the mechanic changes (which were of no concern to me as i want my bug to just visually look like an Oval). So i decided to look for panels and find out the cost of sourcing them, thats a story for the next time. Till then enjoy the pictures of when i rescued the car .","Joyous...

"I've encountered a lot of ""mechanics"" talking about using worm gear clamps on cooling, oil, etc. hoses because they allegedly perform better than spring clamps. On the other hand, you'll often see OEM hoses using a spring action clamp, like so: Now, I don't buy it. A spring clamp seems to distribute clamping force evenly across the circumference of the hose, reacting to expansion and contraction of the material with temperature changes. A worm gear clamp, by design, would bite harder on one point on the hose and would not evenly distribute clamping force. This effect would only grow worse as a hose expands and contracts. I would assume that after completing several thermal cycles, the clamp would begin to cause a leak or even bite into the hose and breach it.

This effect would only grow worse as a hose expands and contracts. THIS!!! I made a video once and shared it with my freinds on hose clamps, I showed a bunch of clamps which I recall were. spring clamp oetiker cinch clamp ABA blue hose clamps norma torro (Mercedes/BMW) clamp bellville washer loaded worm clamp regular perforated thread worm clamp The best are spring type as they self adjust constantly forever, The bad thing is that they are an exact size and dont work on aftermarket hoses. What I do with hoses that dont use spring clamps, I use a touch of hylomar or no.2 gasket maker (oldschool stuff) on the barb/nipple and then install the hose - it seals the hose and is removable in the future too, it prevents pitting of the barb which eventually leaks. The bellville washer type worm clamp work fantastic but are very pricey - used in HD diesels etc. They are worm clamps which are self adjusting too. The norma and ABA ones wont dig into the hose and apply a bit more even pressure compared to the perforated thread clamp. But are actually inferior to spring clamps in this regard, however they can easy accommodate aftermarket hoses too.",,

"Dear PakWheelers I am browsing this forum's pages since last few days, especially related to Toyota Corolla 2.0D, because I might buy one in the near future. Now let's come to the topic of concern for me. I am a bit confused related to Toyota 2C engine oil recommendation that I discovered on the PakWheels forum pages. Most people recommend Caltex Delo Gold Ultra; ZIC 5000; and some people suggest putting any good diesel engine oil with API CI-4 rating. While checking the 2C's repair manual, I got to know that the recommended API rating for 2C engine is CF (CE and CD can also be used). Next, I checked various well-known engine oils that are famous especially for petrol engines, for example, Mobil 1 5W-50 Peak Life and OW-40 New Life, Shell Helix Ultra 5W-40, ZIC XQ 5W-40 and so on and so forth, they all have API rating of SN/CF or SM/CF. The ""oil guide utility"" or ""oil selector utility"" that is available on many oil manufacturers' websites (Mobil, Eurol, etc.) and they primarily used for choosing right engine oil for any particular car. The user provides the make, model, year and engine type to the utility and the utility, in response, recommends a particular oil based on the car manufacturer's recommendation. In European countries, 2C engine came in Toyota Carina E and perhaps in Toyota Avensis during 1990s. The oil guide utilities from different oil vendors recommend ONLY API CF oil for 2C engines. In these countries, 2C engines easily last for about 500,000 KMs and more without any major overhaul. And if you visit any automobile store, they don't recommend any CI-4 oil for 2C engines. So, here comes my question. Has any owner of Corolla 2.0D tried putting such engine oils with API SN/CF rating that are popular for petrol engines like Shell Helix Ultra 5W-40 fully synthetic, Mobil 1 5W-50, ZIC XQ or any other fully synthetic oil with API SN/CF rating?

Secondly, people listen to rumours spread by people who never owned diesel vehicles in their whole life, but always want to talk about bads of diesel engines becoz they heard them from one who again never owned a diesel vehicle. As far as I have seen diesel engine problems are highlighted much than actual. Im telling this whole story bcoz in the past I owned a 10 years old 2.0D Indus Corolla for 5 years and I claim that it was the best vehicle I ever owned and never gave me trouble in five years. Routine maintenance done for five years like Engine oil Delo Gold + filter, genuine Air filter, Best quality Fuel filter and Toyota Coolant (pink color) were only changed @ proper time. No doubt that Diesel is expensive than Petrol, still per km cost of diesel vehicle is lesser than that of petrol. very true Just because anyone is holding a spanner and a pliers means that they actually know what they are doing. Get in touch with the manufacturer (meaning read their repair manual). That manual will tell you in simplest form what is ""NORMAL"" and what is not, That book will also tell you ""HOW"" to get back to ""NORMAL"" e.g. lets take 2 diesel engines, one from an ancient 1975 200D benz and one from a corolla, both are 4 cyl and 2000cc - should one assume that both are repaired the exact same way?",,

While checking the 2C's repair manual, I got to know that the recommended API rating for 2C engine is CF (CE and CD can also be used). Next, I checked various well-known engine oils that are famous especially for petrol engines, for example, Mobil 1 5W-50 Peak Life and OW-40 New Life, Shell Helix Ultra 5W-40, ZIC XQ 5W-40 and so on and so forth, they all have API rating of SN/CF or SM/CF. The ""oil guide utility"" or ""oil selector utility"" that is available on many oil manufacturers' websites (Mobil, Eurol, etc.) and they primarily used for choosing right engine oil for any particular car. The user provides the make, model, year and engine type to the utility and the utility, in response, recommends a particular oil based on the car manufacturer's recommendation. In European countries, 2C engine came in Toyota Carina E and perhaps in Toyota Avensis during 1990s. The oil guide utilities from different oil vendors recommend ONLY API CF oil for 2C engines. In these countries, 2C engines easily last for about 500,000 KMs and more without any major overhaul. And if you visit any automobile store, they don't recommend any CI-4 oil for 2C engines. So, here comes my question. Has any owner of Corolla 2.0D tried putting such engine oils with API SN/CF rating that are popular for petrol engines like Shell Helix Ultra 5W-40 fully synthetic, Mobil 1 5W-50, ZIC XQ or any other fully synthetic oil with API SN/CF rating? Why Pakistani 2.0D needs overhaul most of the time. One reason I know is our ""Ustaads"". Any other valid reasons for overhaul(s)? Why we put CI-4 oil?? Is this backward compatible? If yes, why so many problems with our 2.0Ds? Here, I am mentioning links of some oil selector guides from some manufacturers. Which Oil? - Mobil™ UK & Ireland25 Oil Advisor | Eurol B.V.11 CAR PARTS from Mister Auto - Your Parts at discount prices6","2C engine requires overhaul after 400,000 km if maintained properly. Our Ustaads advise every innocent man to get their 2Cs overhaul, coz they need money by any means and poor customer has no other choice due to his limited knowledge about diesels. Secondly, people listen to rumours spread by people who never owned diesel vehicles in their whole life, but always want to talk about bads of diesel engines becoz they heard them from one who again never owned a diesel vehicle. As far as I have seen diesel engine problems are highlighted much than actual. Im telling this whole story bcoz in the past I owned a 10 years old 2.0D Indus Corolla for 5 years and I claim that it was the best vehicle I ever owned and never gave me trouble in five years. Routine maintenance done for five years like Engine oil Delo Gold + filter, genuine Air filter, Best quality Fuel filter and Toyota Coolant (pink color) were only changed @ proper time. No doubt that Diesel is expensive than Petrol, still per km cost of diesel vehicle is lesser than that of petrol.",,
Dear friends I need ur valued suggestion. I have 2013 civic and its oil capacity in 3.7L and honda oil came in same 3.7 litter bottle. Today 1st time I changed my car oil from after market and put in zic a+ 5w20. Previously car is honda maintained so I was using honda genuine motor oil. Now coming to the point. My car capacity is 3.7L oil. But today mechanic put 4L in my car which is 300ml extra and its a fraction over on my dip stick. I want to ask is it ok for R18 engine to have 4L oil or should I remove 300ml extra from the engine.,sikandaralivisionary: no it matters putting even a little bit extra oil than recommended in your car will overfill it which can cause damage to the engine if it was 200 ml less than recommended oil it woudnt have been a problem. 300 ml is no problem. You can go till a quart extra and then it will bust the seals.,,

I want a oil which i can change at 5000Km with Oil filter. Oil Zic XQ may be good for 10000 Km but i dont think so any filter can last for 10K Km. Honestly I am not in a favour of keeping the same oil filter for 10k Km. So that why I am not feeling comfortable with 8-10k Km mileage oil. In Pakistan we have very dusty environment with extreme temperatures, with cars running on low quality fuel. So I think 5000Km is more than enough for our environment. Also you know as per honda recommendation, High-octane is the right fuel for Civic Prosmatec, where as I am using only super. Initially in my 1st 10K Km I used to mix 50-50 High-octane and Super, but know using only super. actually A+ is not fully synthetic as i ve used myself before on my previous car, on the other hand m using fully synthetic shell ultra for last 2 years n always changed oil at 7-8k km was using Zic XQ but its hard to get original XQ nowadays n for my markx i used liqiu moly synthoil fylly synthetic 5w40...always check oil at 5k to see if it still gud to go for another 2-3k km.....even at 7k oil changed theres stickiness of oil.....in US fully synthetic can run upto 15k miles which is quite a lot for Pakistani environment but i think max u can go upto 8k why m saying coz even Audi dealer told me to bring my dad Audi A4 to change oil at 7k km so i think its better to get fully synthetic as they also use fully synthetic oil.....rest is upto u if u change at 5k theres no harm btw do check some threads on imported oil to get more info on fully synthetic oil n their usage time.",,

I was maintaining it from honda for 30k km. But as far as honda oil is concern they use total fully synthetic 5w30 and their rexommended oil change is 5k km. But honda oil seems to be totally worn out at 5000 km. And I am really concern about it. Also there are only 2 honda showrooms in islamabad and rawalpinda. I used to go to honda center in pindi. And im not satisfied with there work and expertise. I bought my car in october 2012 just after its launch but at that time they dont even know how to adjust headlights. But I was maintaining from them for warranty purpose only. Now decided to go out for better service and honestly I have my doubts on honda genuine motor oil. honda motor oils supplier is shell as far as i remember, all the hondas my family own always get them maintained from honda centre i-8. or is it that we are being sloppy i might be wrong. i guess honda oils are there for a reason, might aswell go for company recommended because if something goes wrong i will bust their face wide open and get it right lol",,

"AOA All, I am going to post the procedure to clean a MAF sensor. (You can check the details about MAF Sensors on the net) Basically it measures the Air Flow into the engine and adjusts the fuel ratio accordingly. If the sensor is covered with dirt (or oil from the cold air intake if installed) the sensor will give the wrong readings and this will effect the performance of the car, it is more noticeable in automatic cars. Most of the Mechanics advise to replace it as soon as they notice that the cars response is slow and not upto the mark. But actually you do not need to replace it, just cleaning the sensor CAREFULLY can solve the problem. I will post pictures and details below.","i cleaned maf of my idsi..it was not that big,it was just a 1.5 inch needle like thing which was located at the back of air intake box...i disconnected the cable,took it out,cleaned wid a tissue paper nd put it back in it had a black greasy stuff on it...",,

"My car (Toyota Belta 1.3, 2SZ engine) AC compressor had gone bad with a lot of carbon in it. I have changed the condenser, discharge pipe and compressor.

If your mechanics are not using scales to fill gas, the system will overcharge and then the solenoid starts to go crazy.

"AOA Everyone, I bought a 2012 Toyota Corolla GLi Automatic back in Jul 12. Out of the many things which i had in mind for the new car, the most important thing was the installation of Cruise Control in the vehicle as it shares the same engine (1ZR-FE), same transmission and most importantly the same engine control unit or the ECU. So after a year of research, importing of different parts and lots and lots of waiting Today finally by the help of Allah Almighty i have managed to make the cruise control work. Before we engage in the discussion that why i didnt go for the altis cruisetronic in the first place, well the answer is simple if i had the money i would have definitely bought it (The price diff was Rs 160k at that time dont know about now) A few parts that i had to change in order to make the CC work are: A used leather wrapped steering wheel with audio controls and built in cruise control switches (Came as a bonus) from ebay.uk Altis clock spring or spiral cable from Hamza Younis Auto in Rwp 2011-13 Altis speedometer from Indus motors karachi And then a few wiring issues sorted out by Arshad Auto Electrician in Rwp Here i would also like to thank Mr Zunny aka ZZ for his valuable input and help in procuring the parts for the car I found a complete DIY for installation of cruise control in toyota corolla on the net which helped me a lot in this installation",M surprised how you got such clean second hand products. Stuff at the Sultan place is often rotten - or too pricey if any clean piece is available. The rates you have mentioned are just fine! Sent from my ST25a using PW Forums mobile app,,

If someone know the consumption on CNG, it will help more.. Kind Regards,","Speaking of 6-cylinder engines, I have swapped a few 1999 Galant GDIs with 6A12 and 6A13 engines. I replaced the entire setup, including the touch panel A/C and manual select (auto gears - also known as tiptronic). The 6A12 is a 2.0-liter V6 engine manufactured by Mitsubishi. It provides a very smooth performance, saving engine mounts and eliminating any vibrations while running. Moreover, it sounds really good. The fuel consumption, however, is slightly higher compared to its 4-cylinder counterpart, the 4G63 SOHC NA engine, resulting in a difference of approximately 1 km per liter. However, the tradeoff for this increased fuel consumption is the great sound and smooth acceleration provided by the 6A12 engine.",,

"While this story is longer and involves multiple wasted hours, expensive bottles of oil and miles of travel over the past few months, I've abridged it for clarity and to highlight my most recent outrageous experience with Imran Gearbox Repair5 in Liaquatabad (nee Lalookhet.) After having the 5MT and transfer case opened up on my '90s Suzuki Jimny, I was pleased to see both boxes in pristine condition. It certainly helped that the first thing I did when I got the car is replace the murky black fluids that hadn't been changed in 30 years with Toyota GL-4 and GL-5. After the shaft seals and a couple of bearings were inspected and replaced with new ones, the boxes were put back together and I was asked to put in the shop's ""khulla"" oil of unknown spec. Since there was absolutely no way I was going to do that, Warco or Delo Gear EP-5 was the alternative. While the Delo GL-5 would've been fine for my diffs, it wouldn't work for the transfer case and transmission, which both needed GL-4. ""Sir ham toh dekhte bhi nahi hain, GL-4, 5, sab aik hi cheez hay. Ham dalte rahe hain, sab chalta hay, befikar rahain."" I couldn't find a GL-4 Delo, so I bought some Liqui-Moly 85W-90 GL-4 - 1.2L in the transmission, 1L in the transfer case. 1.5L Liqui-Moly 85W-90 GL-5 each in the diffs. The owner at Imran Gearbox Repair insisted I fill 2 liters into the gearbox, and had their worker dump it into the shifter hole instead of using the fill bolt to verify the quantity. I was pissed and asked him why he did that without telling me. ""Hamara experience hay, kam na ho, gearbox jal na jaye, aapki zimedari hogi."" Straining synchros, hard downshift to 2nd and 1st, and sluggish response made me suspect the box was overfilled. The shifter shaft bolt at the very top of the gearbox was leaking, dripping onto my driveway. Output seal was weeping and covering my driveshaft with oil. Next day, the guy wouldn't respond to my calls or messages, including the pictures I sent him of the shifter shaft bolt dripping and leaking all over my driveway. I had a trusted shop open up the fill bolt, which immediately spouted oil all over the mechanic's arm and face. I thrust a beaker underneath to measure what came out. Remember: the spec calls for 1200ml, the gearbox had 2000ml in it. This is how much came out of the fill bolt.

I couldn't find a GL-4 Delo, so I bought some Liqui-Moly 85W-90 GL-4 - 1.2L in the transmission, 1L in the transfer case. 1.5L Liqui-Moly 85W-90 GL-5 each in the diffs. The owner at Imran Gearbox Repair insisted I fill 2 liters into the gearbox, and had their worker dump it into the shifter hole instead of using the fill bolt to verify the quantity.

Next day, the guy wouldn't respond to my calls or messages, including the pictures I sent him of the shifter shaft bolt dripping and leaking all over my driveway. I had a trusted shop open up the fill bolt, which immediately spouted oil all over the mechanic's arm and face. I thrust a beaker underneath to measure what came out. Remember: the spec calls for 1200ml, the gearbox had 2000ml in it. This is how much came out of the fill bolt.

Btw You can find copper washers at dedicated nut and bolt shops, or simply go to lawrence road screw/nut/bolt market and buy some, However you can also buy them near sindh madressah, some shops are there selling all kinds of fasteners, they are run by gujrati speaking bohra faith guys. I used to buy a lot from them, mind you they wont entertain any soot/inchi size or andaaza size, you will need to tell them exact metric or sae sizing, they also have all kinds of c clips, r clips, ring locks etc too. They also had the silken thread used to seal pratt and whitney engine casings.",,
"While this story is longer and involves multiple wasted hours, expensive bottles of oil and miles of travel over the past few months, I've abridged it for clarity and to highlight my most recent outrageous experience with Imran Gearbox Repair5 in Liaquatabad (nee Lalookhet.) After having the 5MT and transfer case opened up on my '90s Suzuki Jimny, I was pleased to see both boxes in pristine condition. It certainly helped that the first thing I did when I got the car is replace the murky black fluids that hadn't been changed in 30 years with Toyota GL-4 and GL-5. After the shaft seals and a couple of bearings were inspected and replaced with new ones, the boxes were put back together and I was asked to put in the shop's ""khulla"" oil of unknown spec. Since there was absolutely no way I was going to do that, Warco or Delo Gear EP-5 was the alternative. While the Delo GL-5 would've been fine for my diffs, it wouldn't work for the transfer case and transmission, which both needed GL-4.

Btw Buying in plaza is no different than buying anywhere else, the same usual jargon is used Anyway!!! The large dust lip oil seal is not exactly mandatory, you can use a regular oil seal too, dont go wide unless your seal housing boss allows it, and if the manual specs it, some housings actually specify a gap at the end of the seal boss so oil can flow there (keeps it cool and prevents cooking) For copper washers, if you were in plaza, just ask rando shops where the nut/bolt guys are in magazine lane, this lane is actually next to the oil filter market you visited. Ask for “taambay ki washer” and not “copper washer” - otherwise you wont find them. And dont ever throw away copper washers, they are reusable forever with just a simple annealing.",,

Mainly interested in heat and UV blocking, don't want to tint the windows so looking for film with 70-80% visible light transmission, no color/tint, non-reflective. Protek offers 3M crystalline but its not ceramic and quite expensive. Solar screen offers X series but no idea if its actually ceramic as its their own brand, not some internationally recognized film.","Consider getting Z series metallic tint from Solar Screen for your cars, as it doesn't affect mobile signals and offers significant heat reduction, especially beneficial for smaller vehicles. While initial bubbles may be annoying, they typically disappear with sunlight exposure. The tint is practically invisible, and there have been no reported issues with law enforcement. Prices for installation, like for a Pixis 2018, may vary but are generally reasonable, around 9500 rupees. Solar Screen's Lahore outlet remains operational, offering services like ceramic coating, which has shown a 50% reduction in cabin heat and improved AC performance, albeit with some initial bubbling that clears within a week.",,

While the Sportage is locally produced and relatively easy to maintain with good resale value, the Terios Kid provides an affordable alternative with its sleek design.

"Hi guys salam This is my first post on this forum, i have recently bought mark 2 1973 and luckily the car is in its original condition. I am planning on upgrading it to muscle car Big engine ( non turbo will be better i gues) upgrading braking upgrading rear differential and shaft ( i think it would need to be changed as heavy engine will probably damage stock differential ) hollow rims with wide tires ( how wide ? ) After all the mechanical works i will move to body works, now i can either stick to the original look and prolly go for front lower lip type bumper or change it to muscle ( dodge look) what do you think ? need some picture. will also upgrade exhaust to get a roar sound out of it. The real question is what engine will be best suitable ( 2zj ?? is it 2zj or 2jz??) , is it reliable ? ( price ?) Has any one successfully completed mark 2 conversion? do you think wide arches will be good or it will spoil the look ? i had so much to type but tried my level best to summarise what i was after, Looking forward to get some valuable information from you guys.

Ensuring tractable power and controllability is vital, as seen with old American cars like the Ford Galaxie 7 litre. Additionally, when contemplating engine swaps such as a 2JZ in a '73 MKII, it's essential to assess the feasibility and potential challenges, including the need for custom mounts and addressing rear suspension issues. Furthermore, active involvement in the project, especially concerning wiring and other technical aspects, can prevent unforeseen issues and ensure quality workmanship.

In recent v18 maps, that area is totally absent from the terrain. Moreover some roads and streets are there but those aren't named or if named, named wrongly. So using latest version maps data is of no particular help. I'm still using v14 Sygic.",,

"-- Throttle Body (TB) is the fuel and air intake controller of a petrol engine -- With new sensor and ECU technology this is slightly complex area (for some), yet we clean it very often -- Of many people I interviewed almost everyone has either replaced a sensor or has had serious idling issues If u want to know how it works ... how to save your sensors and how to remove various idling issues ... please read this i will explain with a lot of details and pics so that someone who has never known throttle body may also understand but some portions may be un-necessary which u may skip ( NOTE : TB design varies for different cars i cannot cover all .. just giving a basic concept here ) Location in engine  -- it connected at one end to your air-cleaner assembly and on the other to the in-take housing as shown in the pic below  Parts of TB which need to be understood for maintenance and adjustment There is a diagram of TB below. Following is the list i will discuss in detail just keep refering to this diagram when reading ahead; -- Accelerator Linkage (it has an idle adjustment screw not visible here ).. right most item in diagram -- The air-cleaner side ... marked as 10 -- Hot water pipes ... 40 -- TPS (throttle position sensor) ... 20 -- IACV (Idle air controller valve) other names include ISC (idle servo controller) and Auto-choke .. 70 -- A housing with its seal or gasket .. 57 is the gasket  Parts wise explanation and adjustment  .. Accelerator Linkage it has two main parts which u need to understand -- butterfly ..  [INDENT=2]-- Function : it controls amount of air and when u press accelerator it moves [/INDENT] [INDENT=2]-- Problems : general problems include being stuck and/or not sealing the pipe like housing completely -- Symptoms : Jerky pickups and increased idle RPM -- maintenance : is to completely clean it with petrol and remove carbon sludge   [/INDENT] [INDENT]-- idle adjustment : Just a simple screw to adjust idle BUT this adjustment comes after the basic adjustment of idle from TPS and IACV (explained ahead) .. for minor adjustments use this screw .. generally it has a lock nut as well  [/INDENT] .. Air Cleaner side or housing .. just to give u an orientation of TB location in engine .. Hot water pipes .. these are the source of temperature for auto-choke, early morning start races up ur idle till water attains certain temperature (around 70 degrees centigrade)  .. TPS : The most important item which causes major idling issues, it[INDENT]-- Working : has a linkage (generally a black plastic) which sits in a housing, the housing replicates the movement of butterfly and in turn gives a position identification to ECU (the main computer unit) that what is the position of butterfly at any point in time --Construction : In general it is a simple variable resistance which changes value due to movement of its mechanical linkage .. the voltage coming ang going out of it varies from 1v to 5v which tell ECU the position of butterfly (or accelerator pressed) -- Sub-Parts [/INDENT] [INDENT=2]-- linkage : plastic flat body .. it sometimes sits in a window like shape in TB housing be sure it is vertical or fits the window properly (this is important, the main issues start here, any) -- Adjustable screw and/or spring : TPS gives the primary signal of throttle position if it is wrong, everything else will remain messed up ... there is a process to set it, explained bellow: [/INDENT] [INDENT=3]Adjustment process -- When engine is running .. remove IACV connector (ur idle will reduce ..just normal) -- not adjust the TPS screw or play (as shown in pic below) so that idle is 400-500 rpm (for non-rpm car where engine vibrates and will stall if lowered) .. use the idle screw in the accelerator linkage to achieve this level -- now connect IACV and you'll get perfect idle of 800-850 RPM   WHY : the IACV or auto-choke controls rpm within a certain limit for some reason if u have set to 2500 rpm (from TPS) then either u'll get a eratic idle or a stalling behaviour .. general problem when a mechanic opens, cleans and fits it back not knowing that its play is also an adjustment  [/INDENT] .. IACV : -- Function : It gets reading from TPS and senses water temperature to accelerate the RPM when required, general these include  [INDENT=2]-- turning ON ac -- Cold start -- Other electrical load like power steering turning, operating head-lights, defogger, etc -- Atmospheric requirements like air is thin in hilly areas[/INDENT] [INDENT]-- Construction : It is a stepper motor which works in steps in accordance with voltage applied. Like telescopic rod it pushed butterfly forward to increase the RPM. The step in normal condition are around 10-15 and with AC ON can be up to 100 or 125 (its max limit) -- Checking a Faulty IACV : remove connector when engine is start ur rpm should vary. still not sure, remove IACV from housing put ur finger on sensor tip an just turn ignition key (do not start) and it will expand, the telescope pod will move forward .. turn off key and it will retract with a delay of about 2 seconds, third check is resistance generaly it is around 30-40 ohms in between it pins from centre pins to outwards   Problems : RPM not increasing when required (as given in its functions) and eratic RPM (too high or too low) in noral condition, this involves basic idle setting as explained in TPS above [/INDENT] -- Housing : this is where water accumulates, the only problem u get here is an expanded seal when ur mechanic cleans it with petrol and when fitting back it doesn't sit back properly creating a leakage  WARNINGS : -- never clean sensors with a brush there tips are carbon quoted and either they will give error in reading or will eventually die if this practice is followed. Mechanics put them in a tub of petrol and clean with a brush -- use only prescribed sprays or solutions to clean sensor. My study suggests an elecrtonic circuit cleaner spray only. just spray and then put in the open for half an hour to dry nothing more -- don't mess with idle adjustment of TPS or even its screws if u don't know how to adjust -- Don't check voltages on sensor clips or ur sensor with test lamp it might overload and kill them -- try a reset otr hard reset before doing any of these test/adjustment processes, a reset afterwards is equally recommended Thanks (now i will insert pics .. took me 2 hrs to type this )","This sort of water distribution system is to heat up the whole throttle body, it prevents throttle blade wear in all weather as metal expands and contracts with temperature. e.g. the throttle may sieze in ice weather. This little thing when disturbed is the no.1 cause of those pesky cooling system air locks as it is quite a high point in the system. This is also why the pipes feeding it are rusted like a century old sunken ship. (air+water+heat = bad news)",,

Dont fall for brand names - you need to fulfill the basic battery operational requirements first, then comment on quality. If your battery failed in 16 months - you need to look at the root of the problem",,

(basic school physics) anyways to the rest saying that battery life is 1 year, that means that my house cars in Pakistan are either really lucky or there is some voodoo going on. The last batteries installed in them were in 2008, and they still show absolutely no problems, And I dont fiddle with the cars that much.

"Hi all Car gurus, Please give your opinion regarding best battery brand in Pakistan esp for a diesel engine vehicle, I mean durability and quality.","autophile;2790665: Xulfiqar bhai. the optimum or peak life is one year, however, batteries can last much longer. I however change when first time battery is unable to rev the self starter and that moment comes once in three years. I know that I can still use the battery by replacing electrolyte or recharging it, but as someone said above a weakening battery puts load on the alternator:) so better have a full strong battery after two or three years. BTW my friend is using stock FB battery in his 2006 Xli. He says that it still revs the self and car starts on two selfs and the horn has become weaker but the battery is still running after five years:) The life of battery also depends on how many start/stops in a day you have. I have tons of starts/stops a day:) my diesel VW in Pakistan had about 10 start stops per day on average, that little engine has a 23:1 compression ratio with a planetary gear starter sucking 400 amps on startup. Still uses the same AGS battery I installed in it. The other jap cars also face similar duty, If your battery was prepared nicely, and you positively know for sure that your whole circuit is good, (meaning no corrossion on grounds etc) and your alternator is good - the battery will live a long life. I see people in Pakistan push start a dead battery car and then expect the alternator to fully charge the battery (for sure the alternator will fail shortly and undercharge/damage the battery and the next battery and the next too).

"I have a 1984 Toyota Corolla with an engine swap of 1N diesel (non-turbo). It has been running perfect after 17 years with unbelievable fuel economy. I would like to know about the possibility of installing a turbocharger on it. The 1N-T is the Toyota engine with turbocharger installed as default. Does the 1N engine have the mount to install the turbocharger. My engine does have an extra air cleaner (it is very large) behind the head where the turbocharger is placed on the 1N-T (1N-T does not have extra air cleaner). The extra air cleaner probably does nothing but further restrict the airflow. I would take it off anyway. Question is, can I install a turbocharger on its mount, or if the mount can be improvised? Please help me out so that I go on and look for the CT12 turbocharger.","The IN turbo engine pistons are different - it has cut outs for the piston cooling oil jets and pistons have the cooling slugs in them. The outer bits are that the intake manifold is log type and the exhaust mounts the turbo, the pump has the LDA unit on it. You can do it but it requires careful running if you slap turbo parts on an NA. The engine cannot sustain high stress runs. Otherwise the engine is pretty good for what it is.",,

"Experts here the the car in question is Honda City 2012 with mileage 35000 only, one hand driven only. The problem is the hard clutch pedal. Whenever i stuck in traffic block i literally have pain in my foot by pressing clutch pedal again and again. The clutch pedal is hard to press and i have shown it to different mechanics. Some says its due to bad pressure plate, some says it is due to bad master/slave cylinder and even some says its just fine. I went to mechanic who said that it is due to pressure problem for clutch pressure plate replacement but he did not open it as he was not sure because car is only 35k driven and excellent condition never drive with foot on pedal. Car can have a wheel spin even in 2nd gear too. Now i have a option to go for master/slave cylinder check but there is no symptom of faulty master/slave cylinder. Experts please help me in this regard. Here is information which can help you to advice me. 1) Car can have wheel spin even in 2nd gear, i recently went to Naran and did not face any problem regarding uphill drive or gear changing. 2) One mechanic diagnosed that rubber pipe connecting the line between master and slave cylinder is blocked, he changed it but problem of hard clutch pedal not solved 3) I was also feeling a little problem of hard shift, but after bleeding clutch the problem resolved and also clutch hardness reduced almost 10%. 4) I never ever roasted its clutch by racing/ drag or by keeping foot continuously on clutch pedal. I always used foot rest. 5) There is no leakage, no oil reduction. 6) Working of clutch is fine no any problem except hardness. Please suggest me what should i do??? How to get rid of this problem. One more thing, i have drive my friends same Honda City car but that has so much soft pedal. Even my cultus has so soft pedal. Thread once started cannot be deleted until conditioned, but can be closed. Let us know when ever you like to open it - MOD","When bleeding a clutch or brake, it's essential to measure the oil throw accurately using a clear pipe to prevent backflow. A distance of about 7 inches indicates the oil's travel from the bleed nipple. However, using clear pipes and preventing backflow is crucial for precise measurements. Regarding clutch lifespan, it heavily depends on usage; improper practices like holding the car on an incline with the clutch rather than brakes can rapidly wear out the friction disc. This issue is commonly heard among Honda owners, indicating concerns about clutch durability, especially compared to Toyota models. Some prefer Nissan's cable-type clutch for its perceived reliability. However, the trend in Pakistan leans towards automatic transmissions, with some even considering converting manual Mehrans to automatic. Despite this shift, the availability of technical support for automatic transmissions remains a concern, highlighting the need for trained mechanics specializing in automatic gearbox repair and maintenance.",,

They dilute the oil and promote corrosion and sludge. Positive Crankcase Ventilation serves to cycle clean air through the crankcase, evacuating the combustion gases, by using intake manifold vacuum as a motive force. The PCV valve vents from the engine block directly to the intake manifold. At idle and low RPMs, vacuum in the IM draws the spring loaded PCV valve open and creates negative pressure in the crankcase. Clean, filtered air from the airbox is tapped off the turbo-charger inlet pipe by a breather hose, and drawn into the crankcase at the valve cover. This clean air sweeps through the crankcase, carrying the blow-by gas and oil-mist out through the PCV valve, where it is fed into the intake ports to be burned. The flow is one way ]] breather hose ]] crankcase ]] PCV valve ]] intake port. Sport car tuners instal oil catch cans at both the PCV hose and the breather hose to keep contaminants out of the engine and intake.",,

"I purchase an Exide ""Solar 100"" 60Ah (C/20) in October 2021. I got curious about measuring its output, and it ended up at 8.5V after providing just 16.5Ah at a 20W load only a little bit more than a year later. To charge, it absorbs 46Ah towards 14.4V. Clearly, this is ridiculous - I use a great charger, take care of the battery's temperature, float and storage voltage. It was likely prepared with shitty electrolyte and has failed juuust out of warranty. Where can I sell (preferably sell to recycle) this battery? Battery vendors that will take it and give you a credit towards the purchase of a new battery, I suspect, are ripping me off. I'm assuming I can buy a dry, unprepared, flooded lead acid battery from a battery place. Is this correct? Or would they give me some nonsense about the warranty not being valid if they don't prepare it themselves with water from the local river? Where can I buy battery electrolyte? I've heard of companies like Pyrochem, but nobody picks up their listed contact phones. I could prepare some myself, but where can I buy an appropriate concentration of H2SO4 today? And what other tools for measuring SG exist, other than than a (cheap and locally available) bulb hygrometer? Alternatively, does anyone know of a battery place in Karachi that definitely has good battery prep practices and honor their damn warranties?","All batteries are shipped completely dry to the shops. You can buy it as is too. The acid is sold at chemical market near denso hall / napier road in Karachi, distilled water is also available there or adjacent to the medicine market. - only buy acid produced by contact process (sold in dark brown sealed bottles), do not buy the plastic bottle oleum trash, its max purity is 60% compared to 99% of CP stuff. Want to wager what the battery sellers use? For measuring SG, you can use a basic kitchen scales. We know that water is 1.00 sg meaning 100 ml water weighs 100 grams and 1 litre of water weighs 1 kilogram So by that , a litre of 1.27 sg electrolyte should weigh 1270 grams. Simple school stuff, the risk factor here is mixing both water and acid, its an exothermic reaction and boils violently, so extra caution is required and only add the acid drop by drop (smaller quantities is the idea) Then let it cool down to room temp and then fill the battery cells, let it rest for a 10 mins and then boost charge it for a few minutes, it will bubble quite a lot as all air is dispersed from the plate pores.",,

Therefore, I visited the chemical markets near Denso Hall. I conducted a survey and asked several stores for sulfuric acid. Unfortunately, none of them had opaque glass bottles. Only one store had dirty plastic bottles labeled with an """"S"""" written in marker. They were selling it for Rs. 250, but they wouldn't allow me to test the pH or weigh it on a scale. Approximately eight pounds, not eight ounces. Oh, not ounces, kilograms. Weight matters.

One dealer, Defence Battery Traders, seemed reputable and mentioned they use deionized water with a total dissolved solids (TDS) of 300ppm. Deionized water with a TDS of 300ppm.

Its true that the windscreens have a coating or it is rather called as Lamination coating and when this lamination coating once removed due to heavy buffing then it becomes unfit. I think it is risky to buff the windscreen and if you have decided to do it then take special care by selecting a good experienced person and ask him to do a very light buffing otherwise your windscreen would be ruined. The scratches normally develop due to using inferior quality wiper blades. Never use wipers to clean the windscreen while it is dry. Once in a while spray silicone spray (which is easily available in market in pressurized tin bottle) on the wiper rubbers to make them soft and supple. you are never supposed to even use the word silicone and glass in the same sentence - you will never be able to remove it from the glass, the wiper blades are rub cleaned with alcohol only",,

Here is sign in speedometer which i required your guidance and expert opinion as i dnt know about this sign.,"""Yes, you are absolutely correct. For your resetting question, let me take a look at it. There is an error in the Ek Wagon G 2014 Model 2016 Import Mitsubishi. Attached is an image of the error.  -  - Greetings to all brothers. The error keeps appearing on the Ek 2014-16 import G model. Sometimes it shows 7, sometimes 3 or 4, but mostly this error occurs. Now, the problems I am facing are:  -  - 1. The Auto Start and Go (Eco Idling Stop) is not working. The """"A"""" sign blinks in yellow all the time.  - - When mechanics reset it with a computer, the """"A"""" sign stops blinking, but after 1 or 2 starts, it starts blinking again.  -  - 2. The car is taking a load on the AC excessively, and the AC mostly trips when the car is on.""",,

"Assalamulaikum all. I hope you are all doing well. I haven’t posted at Pakwheels for a long time so I’m here with another project. The car in question is a 2002 HA12 Alto. It’s a PKDM variant which originally came with an F10A engine. The engine was a little over 300,000km driven but it was still running strong. I was getting around 14km/l within city (I know it’s unbelievable for this engine but a combination of keeping it well-maintained, different jets in the carburetor and light foot driving helped achieve this.) The idea behind this swap was to improve the fuel average of the vehicle with the insane fuel prices these days and to convert the transmission to auto. If I could get better performance, that would also be a plus. Now I could go the safe route of a K6 auto swap to get better fuel average but that wouldn’t have cut it because of the lack of power. I could use a K6 turbo instead but that wouldn’t help me achieve the fuel average figure that I was after. Therefore, with limited options to achieve what I wanted, I decided to swap in a Honda L-13A IDSi with a CVT transmission into it. Why an L-13A I hear you ask? a) It is known to have good fuel average, even in heavier cars such as the Honda City, Civic and the Honda Jazz/Fit, b) It would have a CVT Transmission, therefore helping achieve the auto transmission bit and c) with 85hp and about 120nm torque, it would offer good power to weight ratio in a car that weighs a little shy of 700kg. I have an ongoing series of Videos for this project on my channel, you may visit the channel at, www.youtube.com/@funcariauto/19 Here are some specifications of the engine. Engine Code: L13A Engine Capacity: 1339cc (Offered in the 1.4 Honda Jazz GG/Fit GE, 1.4 Honda Civic FD) No. of Cylinders: 4 IDSi – Intelligent Dual Sequential Ignition, which means there are Two Plugs per cylinder, sequentially fired for better efficiency. Power: 85hp @5700RPM / 120nm Torque @2800RPM Compression Ratio: 10.8:1 7 Speed CVT-Transmission (SWRA) Most of the work on it is done in-house, which includes mechanical, fabrication, electrical and aesthetic.

I have an ongoing series of Videos for this project on my channel, you may visit the channel at, www.youtube.com/@funcariauto/19 Here are some specifications of the engine. Engine Code: L13A Engine Capacity: 1339cc (Offered in the 1.4 Honda Jazz GG/Fit GE, 1.4 Honda Civic FD) No. of Cylinders: 4 IDSi – Intelligent Dual Sequential Ignition, which means there are Two Plugs per cylinder, sequentially fired for better efficiency.

"Assalamulaikum all. I hope you are all doing well. I haven’t posted at Pakwheels for a long time so I’m here with another project. The car in question is a 2002 HA12 Alto. It’s a PKDM variant which originally came with an F10A engine. The engine was a little over 300,000km driven but it was still running strong. I was getting around 14km/l within city (I know it’s unbelievable for this engine but a combination of keeping it well-maintained, different jets in the carburetor and light foot driving helped achieve this.) The idea behind this swap was to improve the fuel average of the vehicle with the insane fuel prices these days and to convert the transmission to auto. If I could get better performance, that would also be a plus. Now I could go the safe route of a K6 auto swap to get better fuel average but that wouldn’t have cut it because of the lack of power. I could use a K6 turbo instead but that wouldn’t help me achieve the fuel average figure that I was after.

Can ABS brake be installed in a car ? Does it require a specific engine to install an Abs brake in a car or it can be installed in any vehicle ? Is it reliable and worth it ?,If the car originally came with abs then you can install it including complete brakes etc Otherwise no need to waste time and money.,,

The CYP sensor is inside the distributor.  -  - Regarding the IACV, which type are you using? 2-wire or 3-wire? It sounds like your problem might be a wiring issue. -  - Yes, you can use an OBD1 P08 chipped ECU on your D15B dual VTEC. To make it work, you need to do the following things:  - - Buy or make an OBD2-OBD1 conversion harness.  - - Use OBD1 low-ohm 240cc D15B/D16Z6 injectors or a resistor box from a 92-95 model. - - Use an OBD1 distributor.  - - Use an OBD1 VTEC ECU that can be chipped. - - Use a 2-wire IACV or an OBD1 IACV plug.  - - Use an OBD1 alternator or an alternator plug.  - - You need to either bypass the VTPS switch in your new OBD1 ECU or use Crome to eliminate VTPS. -  - Now, for the Crome part: Crome does not have a ROM/code for dual VTEC. If you want your first VTEC to work with IAB activation, you'll need to alter the wiring and create a pinout for the IAB from the ECU (A-17/A-19, depending on the ECU being used) to the first VTEC solenoid (12-valve mode). Alternatively, you can use a P72 ECU that already has the IAB support. However, even with these modifications, you'll only be able to switch between 1st and 2nd VTEC modes. You won't be able to tune your maps for both modes, as both will run on the 16-valve/VTEC maps. This means that even in 12-valve mode (lean burn), your ECU will still provide fuel as per the 16-valve settings. -  - You can either go through the above steps or simply get a P2J ECU and call it a day! Thank you.",,

"I have a Suzuki Jimny with an F6A turbocharged EFI engine. For the longest time, I've been on a goose chase trying to figure out why my engine would stall, after it had warmed up, when pressing the clutch in. It would either stall and die or idle rough at 900rpm, lighting up the oil pressure light. The first time this happened, I had just changed to Valvoline SynPower 5W-30 API SP. ""Synthatec gaarha nahi hota, gari purani hay, 20W-50 dalen."" I'd rather not kill my turbo, but the oil pressure light was an obvious urgent fix. I switched to Delo Gold Ultra, changed spark plugs, but the issue persisted. I even tested my oil pressure, installed an oil pressure gauge, and am going to back to using 5W-30 or 0W-40 full synthetic oil at the next interval. So it likely wasn't a low oil pressure issue. Eventually, the tiny hoses feeding coolant to the IAC valve in the manifold developed leaks. I bypassed them, and the car idled at 2000-2200rpm, but at least I had oil pressure. Got sick of the ridiculous fuel consumption, got new IAC valve coolant hoses installed back in. New Problem: engine would surge with clutch in and at idle, but only if I gently raised throttle to about 1200rpm. At that point, it would start surging. 2500rpm, 1000rpm, repeat. Obviously, this made driving in stop-and-go traffic very difficult. It happened all the time.The only way to make it stop was to turn on the AC, and even that only slightly calmed it. Turning AC off, or when the compressor disengaged due to the evap coil thermostat, would make the surging come back. Nobody knew what the hell was going on. Until, messing around with vacuum lines, we bypassed this idle control solenoid: Once again, the idle shot up. No surging. Pinch one line off, engine stalls. Aha. The old one seemed to not be working. I found an Afghani replacement, and it solved the problem. Now, I'm trying to figure out what it does and how it's controlled. I notice it doing two things: Adjust idle, bringing it down when high and up when low. I'm confident that it's temperature-dependent. BUT IT ONLY does this (I checked) when: Vehicle completely stopped. Transmission in neutral Clutch not pressed in Dropping idle back down after AC switch is turned off. Once the compressor clutch disengages, engine RPMs rise until ""something"" happens and they drop back down to 1000rpm. That ""something"" doesn't happen if this solenoid is disconnected, and surging starts again once engine rises to 1200rpm. So... what is the control scheme for this thing? How does the ECU determine what to tell it? Is it a normally open solenoid like I suspect? Why does it compensate idle only when those three requirements are met??? I'm puzzled. Is this common across other cars from this era? It's an inconvenience if the car fully warms up in traffic, because unless I come to a dead stop, put it in neutral and give it a second, the car won't set the idle at 1000rpm and ""remember"" it. It'll either do something like 1200rpm or 800rpm, or stall out, unless I do this little dance at a dead stop. The solenoid gets very hot under normal operation, and the Afghan replacement seems to be failing again, behaving inconsistently like the previous one. I want to buy a brand new part, but it's roughly $200. Does anyone have any experience cleaning out and rebuilding these? P.S. Installed an 88°C thermostat, using Glysantin G48 coolant, removed locked-solid clutched fan, installed electric fan with a shroud and temp switch rated for 88°C.

It's an inconvenience if the car fully warms up in traffic, because unless I come to a dead stop, put it in neutral and give it a second, the car won't set the idle at 1000rpm and ""remember"" it. It'll either do something like 1200rpm or 800rpm, or stall out, unless I do this little dance at a dead stop. The solenoid gets very hot under normal operation, and the Afghan replacement seems to be failing again, behaving inconsistently like the previous one. I want to buy a brand new part, but it's roughly $200. Does anyone have any experience cleaning out and rebuilding these? P.S. Installed an 88°C thermostat, using Glysantin G48 coolant, removed locked-solid clutched fan, installed electric fan with a shroud and temp switch rated for 88°C. Engine still doesn't warm up all the way (water temp needle slightly below halfway) unless it's a hot sunny day with AC on. When warm, it's more likely to stall unless I do the 3-step dance.","pwuser162557941033: I still don't know whether the VSVs are normally open or normally closed. When the AC clutch disengages at idle, RPMs rise slowly until they quickly come down again, and this seems to be the role of the VSV pictured in my initial post. If there's no crank speed or angle sensor, how does the ECU know when idle is at the set point? My guess is injector or ignition coil duty cycle. Or some kind of lookup table for the MAP sensor? There is always a crank speed sensor (how else would it time the ignition) - even if its just a simple 3 pole reluctor to time the cylinders. VSVs can be both types, NC or NO - it depends on what their purpose is. But - good job on resolving it. It has the same setup like an old corolla, the AC has its own idle up VSV with a bleed adjustment. On the older corollas, the problem I usually faced was removed thermostat, completely jammed IAC (because it would default to high idle due to cold temp) - and the additional wax pellet valve also stuck open. I had to remedy most with a thorough cleanup or replacement - usually the small metal coolant tubes would be clogged full of rust (highest point in system and air loves to trap there causing steam cavitation) - let the engine warm up fully to let the wax pellet open up - then refiddle the idle speed from the ""verbotten"" stop screw - (the screw that no mechanic in the world would touch, other than a Pakistani ustaad) Finally start the AC and adjust the VSV to correct idle quality - the way it should work is that the idle up would start a few miliseconds before the compressor starts - this way the engine would never lower its idle speed and would smoothly keep running. (make sure your car has its original AC amp in it too - it enables that little delay), Similarly when the compressor disenages, you will feel the engine rpm raise a bit (car wants to nudge forward if in D and foot on brake) - this is all normal.",,
"I have a Suzuki Jimny with an F6A turbocharged EFI engine. For the longest time, I've been on a goose chase trying to figure out why my engine would stall, after it had warmed up, when pressing the clutch in. It would either stall and die or idle rough at 900rpm, lighting up the oil pressure light. The first time this happened, I had just changed to Valvoline SynPower 5W-30 API SP. ""Synthatec gaarha nahi hota, gari purani hay, 20W-50 dalen."" I'd rather not kill my turbo, but the oil pressure light was an obvious urgent fix. I switched to Delo Gold Ultra, changed spark plugs, but the issue persisted. I even tested my oil pressure, installed an oil pressure gauge, and am going to back to using 5W-30 or 0W-40 full synthetic oil at the next interval. So it likely wasn't a low oil pressure issue. Eventually, the tiny hoses feeding coolant to the IAC valve in the manifold developed leaks. I bypassed them, and the car idled at 2000-2200rpm, but at least I had oil pressure. Got sick of the ridiculous fuel consumption, got new IAC valve coolant hoses installed back in. New Problem: engine would surge with clutch in and at idle, but only if I gently raised throttle to about 1200rpm. At that point, it would start surging. 2500rpm, 1000rpm, repeat. Obviously, this made driving in stop-and-go traffic very difficult. It happened all the time.The only way to make it stop was to turn on the AC, and even that only slightly calmed it. Turning AC off, or when the compressor disengaged due to the evap coil thermostat, would make the surging come back. Nobody knew what the hell was going on. Until, messing around with vacuum lines, we bypassed this idle control solenoid: Once again, the idle shot up. No surging. Pinch one line off, engine stalls. Aha. The old one seemed to not be working. I found an Afghani replacement, and it solved the problem. Now, I'm trying to figure out what it does and how it's controlled. I notice it doing two things: Adjust idle, bringing it down when high and up when low. I'm confident that it's temperature-dependent. BUT IT ONLY does this (I checked) when: Vehicle completely stopped. Transmission in neutral Clutch not pressed in Dropping idle back down after AC switch is turned off. Once the compressor clutch disengages, engine RPMs rise until ""something"" happens and they drop back down to 1000rpm. That ""something"" doesn't happen if this solenoid is disconnected, and surging starts again once engine rises to 1200rpm. So... what is the control scheme for this thing?

When I buy a car from showroom my cars windshield never gets damaged as i buy fresh rubber every other season for replacement and i cover my car with top cover when parked. As Saad mentioned that its bare glass that a car comes with and the car screen can be buffed a few times before its starts to show signs of irregularity that can distort the view due to uneven buffing. Once or twice is no problem. A good buffer never buff the glass sealant adjacent or closeby areas as the sealant can lose its properties with the heat generated during this process.

"Considering the abundance of people that use tap water in their vehicle's cooling systems, this is essential.","No, it is bad. Theoretically is it more bad then soft water. Since is electron hungry, and other then that it absorbs CO2 from air quickly and become slightly Acidic. Better to add coolant with distilled water Or use Soft water.",,
"Considering the abundance of people that use tap water in their vehicle's cooling systems, this is essential.","AC condensate is moisture in the ambient air that condenses on the fins of your AC's evaporator. Theoretically, it would have no solids at all, except that by the time it travels down your evaporator fins, pools at the bottom of the pan, and drips down the drain hose and into a container, it's already accumulated some foreign debris. The point is to not use water alone in your cooling system. Coolant concentrate is diluted with distilled/deionized water to form the final fluid that goes into your engine's cooling system. Coolant lubricates the water pump, raises the boiling point beyond 100°C, lowers the freezing point below 0°C, prevents corrosion, and prevents damage from cavitation. There really is no reason not to use it. Nobody seems to have read the contents of the image. Only certain regions in the United States have tap water that is suitable (although not ideal) to use in an automotive cooling system, with a solids content of less than 120ppm. You do not want solids (or gases, for that matter) in your car's cooling system.",,

Replace the expansion valve with a new and genuine part, use a single capillary valve. The twin one is obsolete and no longer available. It basically has a bypass built into it. make 1000% sure the condenser is good and the O rings are installed with nylog (A/C supply shops sell it). Do not let your technician charge the system by inverting the cans - liquid can damage the valve plates in the compressor. Let the system suck on it own power, to get the last bit of gas out of the can get a pan of hot water and dunk the refrigerant can in it as it is charging.",,

The oil sumps in these vehicles are generally small, which makes heat dissipation more difficult with a smaller oil sump. Based on my limited knowledge, the ideal and best engine oil grade for most 660-1000 cc non-hybrid vehicles throughout the year is 5w-30. Perhaps 5w-20 may be suitable for city traffic in winters, but not for highways or extreme summer heat. In any case, 0w-xx is not recommended.",,

Personally, I have had an excellent experience with ENEOS SUSTINA 5W30 SN/RC. You can find it at http://www.eneos.pk/sustina-5w30-snrc/76. It costs Rs. 4500 for a 4L pack and can easily last for 8000 kms with city traffic, extreme rush hours, and highway driving. -  - Alternatively, you can also consider using QUARTZ 9000 FUTURE GF5 5W30. The 1L pack is priced at around Rs. 835, and the 4L pack is approximately Rs. 3128. You can find more information about the prices at http://totalparco.com.pk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Price-list-of-AO-01-March-2018.pdf. -  - I advise against using ZIC oil. Please note that as of 22-05-2018, Shell, Mobil, Liqui Moly, and Caltex Chevron do not offer 5W-30 fully synthetic oil, so they can be eliminated from consideration.",,

At that time, there were no other well-known brands offering 5w-30 fully synthetic oil. So, I ended up using Havoline ProDS Fully Synthetic LE SAE 5W-40 oil, thinking that it is close enough to 5w-30. It was my first experience, and I regretted it. Since then, my car's engine has almost failed. It struggles to reach speeds of 0-20 km/hr within 8-10 seconds, and the fuel efficiency has also decreased. Previously, the eco light used to turn off, but now it doesn't even turn on. (I own a Passo 2013 with a genuine odometer reading of around 38000 kms). So, my sincere advice is to not even consider using 5w-40 oil in your vehicle.",,

I understand your question now. For your Toyota Passo, which is a 2013 model with an odometer reading of 38000 kilometers, you are wondering about the recommended oil viscosity. 5w-30 is generally considered a good option that can be used throughout the year, as it is versatile. You personally have had a positive experience with it. -  - However, you are curious about other options like 5w-20, 0w-20, or even 0w-30 for your vehicle. You travel about 70 kilometers daily on the Islamabad Expressway and occasionally take the motorway twice within a span of three months. -  - You have tried using 5w-40 in the past but do not want to continue with it. Apart from 5w-30 and your brief experience with 5w-40, you have no knowledge or experience regarding 5w-20, 0w-20, or 0w-30 for a Toyota Passo.

My question is regarding the diesel engines of BMW. I heard they have been a failure in Pakistan due to the low quality diesel in Pakistan. Is this true or this just a myth? Would be grateful if anyone can answer this. THANKYOU,"Sounds like someone needed a payday. All of these DI diesels use taper wedge compression rings which means that they will show low compression on cranking test. From my own experience of dewan bmw, they dont have even a single bmw trained mechanic, the only person holding a cert is the SM who sits in an ac office all day long. Dewan also have a habit of hiring morons in their corporate office side too. But anyway, the old wives tale of “diesel ki kwaltee” in Pakistan is nothing more than hearsay. The mechanics tearing down engines for overhaul because “diesel ki kwaltee, bohot carbon etc” are basically milking the client for all his worth as the labour cost will make a very nice payout. A very simple acid test of these mechanics by asking to exhaustively and visually prove the failure will quickly filter out the crooks, in dewanay case would be 100% of the staff including corporate officers.",,

The car has completed 215,000 kms on the ODO and till last month it was running on original engine (without any rebuild). For the last 3 / 4 months, I observed that car losses its power gradually by the time and vibration in engine at idle or low rpm. The car moves to & fro (jerks) when stopped on signals/traffic while in D position. The jerking is quite high and I have to bring the gear lever to N while the car is stop. The car has no cold/hot starting issues and always start in one self. no overheating history, thermostat valve is in place and fans are auto. In Pakistan, the car is mostly driven on CNG (almost 100k kms). IMO Overall engine is in good condition having no engine oil loss, blue smoke, carbon deposits at silencer end, smooth engine sound etc. Last month, due to missing, vibration and lack of power, my mechanic advised me to rebuild its engine head with new valves, valve seats and machining etc. I followed his advice and rebuild engine head with new taiwan valves set and related stuff, the machining was done at Al-Madinah Engineering at water pump. After dis-assembling, we have found one exhaust valve seat burnt and that particular cylinder was misfiring. After rebuild, i observed that the engine missing/vibration has gone and power is restored to an extent (but not completely) I notify the matter to mechanic but as they all said, it will be better with time (and it doesn't). Now the condition is, the car performs well for 6k kms after the rebuild and during the last week I started observing slight vibrations in engine, car also vibrates/jerks minutely when stop in D position. The missing can be heard at exhaust tip also. The mechanic is so dumb he cannot feel the vibration and missing and advice me to either increase engine RPM through software or ignore it, its all normal. (well IMO its not).

IMO Overall engine is in good condition having no engine oil loss, blue smoke, carbon deposits at silencer end, smooth engine sound etc. Last month, due to missing, vibration and lack of power, my mechanic advised me to rebuild its engine head with new valves, valve seats and machining etc. I followed his advice and rebuild engine head with new taiwan valves set and related stuff, the machining was done at Al-Madinah Engineering at water pump. After dis-assembling, we have found one exhaust valve seat burnt and that particular cylinder was misfiring. After rebuild, i observed that the engine missing/vibration has gone and power is restored to an extent (but not completely) I notify the matter to mechanic but as they all said, it will be better with time (and it doesn't). Now the condition is, the car performs well for 6k kms after the rebuild and during the last week I started observing slight vibrations in engine, car also vibrates/jerks minutely when stop in D position. The missing can be heard at exhaust tip also. The mechanic is so dumb he cannot feel the vibration and missing and advice me to either increase engine RPM through software or ignore it, its all normal. (well IMO its not). I think valve seat(s) is/are damaged again and we have a loss of compression in cylinders. My car mostly driven on National Highway within speed of 80km/h to 120km/h.

Kindly also advice, do we have some special valves and valve seats for use in CNG vehicles, as i heard form many that CNG produces high temperature in combustion chamber hence burn valve seats.

"Salam, This project was basically a sort of restoration of a toy car. This toy car was my first birthday gift way back in 1984. Pictures below, Allah has blessed us a son and he is going to celebrate his first birthday. I was thinking of presenting him something different if not special. I decided to DIY of restoring this car. By now you have seen the damages to the car, front bumper, front lights, backlights, rooftop light are missing, stickers, sides broken (near bumpers), windscreen and one window glass is missing or broken. I kicked off the proceedings with front bumper. For this I used milk can and a wall clock plastic base. Used Soldering iron and knife for plastic welding and cutting, heating for giving desired shapes. After this I used sanding and coloring with shinny black spray. Next I picked was front lights, initially I used bike indicators. It was unsuccessful in the end, due to heating process glass became faded and due to low quality plastic, buffing didn't work. Then I used bike helmet visor, it didn't get faded. I am aiming in future phase, to use JDMs broken lights, better quality plastic, buffing would be possible. Beside glass work I also added background chrome, using aluminum foil. For backlights I used bike reflectors, shaped them as per area by heating. For rooftop light, I used a light part from a donor car. For body damages I used filler, sourced from dent/paint shop. Used plastic, mold them as per need, glued them to the broken areas to fill that area. Applied filler for final finish. LEDs were used for illumination, unfortunately I didn't work quiet well in the end. I didn't have much time so I decided to improve it in the next phase. For now I captured the effects in dark. Pictures to follow, For windscreen and window, I also used helmet visor, crafted them, molded them, colored them. For side emblems I took help from plotter (service available at any number plates shop). Result can be seen later in this write-up in final outcome pictures. After completing all the repair work, I proceeded with color process. Used matt black for the lower base, shinny black for glass, side mirrors, bumpers, tyres. Shinny red for the body color and hardener in the end. Now the final outcome: That's all I hope you will like my effort. Thank you for your time.

"AOA , I bought second hand 2007 Model Honda City VARIO , I don't know which oil was used in engine before but I started it with Caltex Synthetic Oil 5W-40 , immediately after that change of oil I heard click click and tik tik sound from engine. I ignored it and kept using it , there was no engine noise on high speeds , I drove it to 140km speed. For my satisfaction l I thought why not try the best one MOBIL 1 5W-50. Even after that the engine noise on idle not removed. I went to Honda 3S and they advised tappets adjustment. After that service ,Noise issue slightly recovered but not fully recovered. I kept using engine in that state for about 2 months but engine noise not resolved. I took advise from some senior technician and he said Engine needs overhauling. That made me depressed and worried as well . because I used best engine oils so why should it happened. Surprisingly there is no issue in driving performance. Engine performance is perfect other than annoying sound click click , tik tik or idle state. On a advice I further tried normal 10W40 Mobil XHP and Mobil imported 20W-50 Super but noise not gone.

Engine performance is perfect other than annoying sound click click , tik tik or idle state. On a advice I further tried normal 10W40 Mobil XHP and Mobil imported 20W-50 Super but noise not gone. Finally HONDA 3S also advise Overhauling. Need help or advise if ENGINE OVERHAULING is the last option for me as no issue in pick or performance ? Any competent ADVISE ?","talhawaleed;4331970: Possible Reasons: [LIST=1] [*]Buildup of sludge which may prevent oil from circulating freely, you should have flushed the oil first using liquimorly engine oil flush and later filled it with new oil. [*] Bad ignition coils, maybe one or more coils are not working. [*]Maybe one of the injectors are so much clogged that its close to not delivering the fuel in one of the cylinders. [*]Vacuum leak from somewhere and maybe clogged PCV valve. [/LIST] Recently I did following with my vehicle. [LIST=1] [*]Replaced the engine mounts which resulted in lesser vibrations from engine. [*]Replaced the advancer/emulator whereas original wirings were short and problem with rough idling was solved and poor accelerations was solved. [*] Bad starting issue was solved by changing from 20w-50 to 5w-30 oil. [*]Stuck gears issue was resolved by filling the gear box with kerosene and let idle for 10-15 minutes on it and later filling it with Honda genuine gear oil which is compulsory for city. [*]Plugs Changed, Throttle body wash, intake manifold cleaning, Injectors cleaning as this was difficult and surprisingly all of them were badly clogged and result was enhanced fuel economy. [*]Leakage in lower engine oil pan and timing chain cover leakage was fixed, surprisingly engine did not lose the oil since then. [*]Brake oil flush using suction machine, braking improved even on old tires. [/LIST] Lost glory was restored after this. From where you got this work done on your car? Honda 3s?",,

Values were 105 95 100 104 psi The car previously overheated too and blew a head gasket (which was fixed by that jugaaru mechanic). All of these seem perfect recipe for a disaster. Before taking up the overhaul, we searched junkyards to find a good clean engine which can be swapped in and save the effort and time of overhaul. But all in vain, junkyard engines were, you guessed it right, junk. Not a single clean 2e, 4e, 4efe, 4afe, 5afe, 7afe (even checked 4ages) was available.

After which, list of parts was made and procured (toyota genuine parts were used when available). Machinist was decided, service manual was arranged and gone through, all bolt torque, clearance etc values were gathered. I had to take leaves from the job to carry this out. First step was multiple runs of real concentrated solution of citric acid in the cooling system (it ran on water and had rust deposits) and then the disassembly started. I will attach pictures and steps in following posts.","There is still a lot of rust in the engine, needs a second dose of acid wash. Btw Good job!!!",,

Engine coolants have additives in it to prevent this very exact thing, If you take out your water pump and have a look you may find little round craters in the backplate - this is caused by cavitation. You might consider ""mehhh - 1500 rupay ka to hay sirf"". This statement can be ok if you own a POS mehran which was design and built by lazy stoned overworked labour, But if you have an engine like saad mentions backing a factory run - cavitation in that engine usually costs about Rs ten million and above, if the cylinder liners also give in. It can in a diesel engine - specially near the cylinder head/block junction. If you ever wonder why your mehran engine block coolant holes are corroded to hell and widened up - it was cavitation foaming at work. coolants are of many types, e.g. GM use the dexcool coolant (like caltex kinoo coolant) which actually does a darn good job of scrubbing out rust and depositing it neatly in the expansion tank. Nice for systems which are 100% liquid. take MB, BMW, etc. they are EU cars and EU has water so damn hard that you need to chew it before drinking, soap forgets how to soap too. They use BASF glysantin for their applications. It is a very good HOAT coolant that does a very good job against cavitation protection, lubrication of pump bearings (its actually slick) and keeping off rust - It cannot remove rust though, for that you need to acid wash the system. It also contains some silicates (needed in diesels) that is why those manufacturers have a packet of some fumed silica in their built in surge tanks to keep adding the required dose. Your average andaa omellete japanese car uses HOAT coolants with phosphated salts - they are quite picky on this - mostly it has to do with the plastics and metals in the unit. SO - please everyone who lives in Pakistan and reads this - do not run your car on plain water cooling system, if you do then dont complain that you are paying heavy for maintenance etc. You yourself are inflicting this pain. Use 50% coolant conc. mixed with distilled water only. Make sure the system is top notch. If your mechanic is so poor he cannot afford a drain tub and a gallon bottle, get your own drain tub and bottle, if he has to drain coolant - make sure he puts it back in the engine, Not let it trickle out onto the ground then proceed to fill with sea water.",,

If you study some F1 engine specs or witness how its started up - it also requires preheated coolant. technically when cold an F1 engine is siezed - the clearances open up only when warm coolant is pumped through it - then hot oil is pressurefed in the ports and finally the engine started.

Maybe all he needs is a oil change and he can get back to us with the results. The biggest problem for him will have to be flushing and topping it up at the right quantity! Dont assume everything is hunky dory in a brand new car, I have had Nissan USA change my 6 month old 10,000 miles driven CVT unit because it was misbehaving. Some new 8 and 9 speed units in chryslers etc. are reported to be bad from the start, they are changed out under warranty, they are so finicky that they wont even select Park unless you program its brain (TCU) which is inside the gearbox itself. deltree;5081638: Local ustaad chutu hai, took me 180k km and a 10 year old car full throttle racing run back to lahore from islamabad in my cvt to break it's belt. Itni nazuk nai transmission k shehar mein kharab hojayay. The heat in lahore is bad agreed but not this bad. I suggest you meet with syncview and troubleshoot this problem he doesn't just look at the error codes he also looks at all the other stuff that can be tested with a tranny. Mitsubishi make a reasonable CVT unit and it works pretty much the same as a JATCO unit, The Honda DCT is pretty but it is sometimes quite goofy and can cause rapid mechanical failure. My local Honda dealer (showroom) has changed about 20 units but they never tear it down, they are shipped in crates back to Honda headquarters for analysis.",,

Now normal trackers are expensive.. (Any cheap or used ones available? pls tell) I was thinking, if I can hide a mobile phone with built in GPS (e.g. nokia n82 etc etc which comes for around 12k max (used)) in car (need good ideas for hiding place), and connect it to mobile car charger and car battery (mobiles battery will serve as backup), i can practically make it a tracking device.. i know of software that can msg me back the exact gps location, or if i subsribe to internet trhough sim,it can update its location live... so i can track it in real time using the internet (e.g. google maps, latitute etc).. I can get all the necessary software (garmin etc etc).. Has anyone tried this before? The problems that I can face are: a) How to connect car battery to mobile phone (probably a work for the electrician). b) Good and safe hiding place for mobile phone c) if the theif or whoever takes battery out.. mobile battery will only last for 3 hours max with GPS on.. after tht it will switch off. How can I switch it back on without touching it physically? d) How can I remotely control the car? lock it etc..

Something a little up the order. BUT, comparing the prices, the Souveran has to be the smoothest wax in the $50-$100 range. Waisay if maybe you could carry a small wax pot when you visit Pakistan, I have one on my wish list which I would love to own. makhdoom123;4982636: Yes Mustafa Bhai , i just noticed it yesterday but didn't had the energy to edit the post that time in shaa Allah will use the wax soon and share the result its nice to know you are a detailing enthusiast too ! Haha, I wash my car in the rain. That should tell you a whole lot about my obsession. What you need now is a sealant. So before you get anything else, save up for that. A sealant and wax combo will do more wonders than what a wax can do alone. Also note, I've used a ton of wax's and like I said, I love the souveran. However, note that its not a durable wax. Its more of a show wax. So expect a maximum of 2 weeks of durability for a daily runner and 3-4 for a garaged weekend car. A sealant will do wonders so keep that in mind when you make your next detailing purchase. There a few that work better than others so don't get whats readily available on PW. There are those who have the good stuff with them but you need to poke em to sell em to you",,

But I could be wrong though. I've bought the Blackfire crystal coating myself. They say the 15ml bottle covers three cars. I doubt that. I'm actually waiting for the current BF Wet Ice over Fire protection combo to diminish on the benz. Until then, I'll put up a thread on DW and AG and ask about the combos I can use over the CC. But since most people use a wax over a CC, I would assume a sealant may also work. I need to do some research myself. However, you can still use a sealant in the engine bay, headlights, glasses and tailights.",,

You should not be waxing a coated car! Waxing it wont do much good... for a coated car what you should do is, clay it. And then maintain with a synthetic spray on sealant i.e. water based. Usually good coating have their own company recommended maintenance spray.. to be used after washing the car(Ideally after claying) as a top up for the coating. I would have recommended something like Carpro Hydro shampoo and its sealant. Coated cars dont need waxing, waxing reduces their water beading and self cleansing effect... any abrasives in the wax will also not be friendly for the coating. Coated cars need periodic Claying to remove any stuck contamination which is reducing water beading and self cleaning effect... Plus a topup for the coating The car hasn't been coated yet.

If he likes waxing.. he can give up the idea of coating. If he wants it coated, he can sell the wax(Must sell easy) and buy some purely synthetic stuff! Waxing a coated car would be somewhat similar to topping up with a 20w-50 Havoline oil, over a Mobil's 0w-30 fully synthetic engine oil! Lol.. The only problem is, I've seen a couple dozen people who wax their coated cars on detailing forum's. I don't remember if the wax's used were synthetic or carnauba. However, they there were mention's not to use sealants on top of coatings. I'm still trying to figure out whats best for a coated car but the claying suggestion is pretty much to the point. Claying + DS is what I think should keep the coating nice and clean. As for the wax, I'll buy that off OP if he decides to sell it",,

The API rating comments are like ""It is for 2004 and older automotive engines."" ""It is for 1996 and older automotive engine."" Sorry but exactly whats the logic behind this ? Whereas these rating are all API revised and indicate the quality of the oil rather than the engine its meant for (Manufacturer usually advise the oil, usually a certain viscosity rating) ... but in no way can u say This rating is for older/newer engines. The guide seems to be suggesting that I shouldnt use a high rated SM/SL oil in my 87 GTti or Integra ... instead use 1996 and older ... obsolete oil ? i hope the people at ZIC don't mind me stepping in here... as engine designs change the requirements of the oils change, over time engines have started producing more power from smaller capacities, and they require different properties fromt the oils. the reason the API ratings change are so that the standards are raised/imporved over time. here is a current chart explainting the ratings:",,

A wide Viscosity Index means the use of VI improvers added to the base oil. These will degrade more quickly, leading to shearing down and change of the properties of the oil, some formulations more than others. More VI improvers do NOT mean it is a better oil just by themselves. It means just that: that the oil has a wide VI when new. Some of best oils have narrow VIs by design. The choice of the oil should be based on the base oil and the additive pack, and these have many more factors than just VI. One should choose the proper viscosity range based on the operating temperatures, the environment, and the use of the engine.

"Hello! On Tuesday morning, when the driver started the car, it had been left on CNG overnight.

"Hello! On Tuesday morning, when the driver started the car, it had been left on CNG overnight. As a result, it took a long time to start, and the starter was strained, as if the engine was running on the starter. Afterwards, the car got stuck or the battery's amperage went down. However, there was no way to start it on CNG. Eventually, it was push-started on petrol, and after running for about 1.5 km, it was switched to CNG and everything was fine. This incident occurred in Karachi, where the current temperature is reported to be 8-11 degrees Celsius. I'm wondering what could have happened to the CNG. Did it freeze in the cylinder or the lines? Or did something get jammed? Any ideas? It seems like the engine was trying to suck in the fuel, but there was nothing in the lines to start the engine. Maybe it froze. Any ideas?

which is the best injector cleaner available inthe market to add in the petrol tank to clean the injectors ?,"To effectively clean built-up sludge in fuel injectors, it's essential to use methods like sonic cleaning rather than relying solely on carburetor cleaner, especially for finer sludge embedded in the injector pintle. Liqui Moly's injector cleaner is recommended for maintenance. For services in Karachi, Welcome Autos in Soldier Bazar and mechanics near the Touchme roundabout in the Sharfabad area are suggested. Regular injector servicing, approximately every 25,000 km, is advised due to the low-grade petrol commonly found in Pakistan, as injector cleaner may not suffice to address the issue entirely.",,
Hello everyone.

Notably, the engine in the shared pictures appears to be a VG30S, and for personalized assistance, initiating a new thread with detailed vehicle history, pictures, and location is advised.

As i approach a speed breaker and apply brake and after crossing the speed breaker when i push the race paddle, i found the engine is off. And sometimes it also do knocking while on low speed. Any solution to solve this problem plz ?","For troubleshooting engine issues, several suggestions have been offered. @tiptop was advised to check vacuum tubes connected to the distributor or visit Obama Car Care Centre in Tipu Block, Garden Town, Lahore, for diagnostics. If the car is carburetor-equipped, the fuel cut solenoid might be a potential culprit. Proper tuning, along with checking plugs, plug wires, and filters (air and fuel), was recommended, with guidance on workshops contingent on location. Additionally, checking the car's alternator/generator was advised. Despite changing plugs and the fuel filter, and cleaning the carburetor with a spray can, one user reported no improvement in their car's performance. Notably, the vehicle runs on petrol and is a 2002 model. A user found resolution at Mini Motor Workshop in Gulberg, where during tuning, a mechanic discovered a damaged electric wire under the carburetor, which, when repaired by an electrician, resolved the issue for a minimal cost of Rs. 75. Tuning charges of Rs. 600 plus 16% government tax were also incurred. Appreciation was extended to all for their suggestions.",,

Which is better for Baleno power steering: Zic Dexron 3 ATF or Kixx Dexron 3 ATF?,"Dexron II, III, and VI are all acceptable for power steering systems, irrespective of brand, with some cases even seeing the use of aviation oils. Dexron III and 3H, although different formulations, became obsolete in the mid-2000s when General Motors phased them out in favor of Dexron VI, now the standard. Dexron 3 may still be available with variations in production quality, whereas Dexron VI has become the norm, and in markets like the USA, Dexron 3 is no longer sold, prompting alternatives like Dex/Merc. Despite differences, Dexron 3, 3H, and 6 remain compatible choices for power steering systems. As long as the product label indicates suitability for power steering use, it should be safe to use, with Dexron 3H being a viable option if Dexron 3 is recommended in the vehicle manual.",,
"Anyone know from where I can buy CASKA navigation system for NEW CIVIC, other then from company, as they charge a lot.. Thanks alot","The issues with the current navigation system seem to be escalating, prompting suggestions to switch to an aftermarket unit, possibly by selling the current one through various channels. While aftermarket units can integrate with steering controls and offer trip data, the integration with car controls and ECU, along with concerns about offline navigation availability, remain challenges. Several popular aftermarket units can be paired with steering controls using a steering wheel module. However, complaints about performance issues persist, including poor touch response, delayed booting, GPS failures, speaker humming, and CD ejection problems. Users have reported dissatisfaction despite multiple replacements, citing issues such as delayed parking camera activation, poor camera resolution, and lack of clear parking indicators. Tracking World has introduced an upgraded iGO3 system to address some complaints, but users still face challenges with video feed quality and system reliability. While warranty claims for upgrades are possible, significant improvements may not be guaranteed. The potential for tablet-based systems as future alternatives is mentioned, although concerns about product quality and customer satisfaction persist. Some users have experienced intermittent loss of multimedia control through steering buttons, further adding to frustrations. One user seeks assistance with restoring default settings on their Honda Civic 2015 iGO3 navigation system, highlighting password retrieval challenges.",,

Why some cars of older models shake left n right from front i mean feeling like swing left n right from its hood Mod: Please create one thread if you have a query .,"Various factors can contribute to a car shaking while driving, including poor aerodynamics, unbalanced tires, suspension issues, worn-out tires, and uneven brake rotors. Brake rotors, also known as brake discs, can cause shaking if worn, but diagnosis without a mechanic can be challenging. Signs of worn rotors include pulsating brakes or noise when braking. Repair or replacement costs vary depending on the extent of damage and the car model. Suspension bushes, tie rod ends, shock struts, and braces can also affect stability and should be checked for wear.

"I'm looking for engine oil dye products online but couldn't find a single local website offering any. Basically, an engine oil dye is a liquid that you can add to your engine and then use a UV light to detect leakage points. It's a simple DIY method for tracing any seepages. It's insane we're so backward that these products aren't even available here and mechanics resort to removing your entire friggin' engine just to detect one minor seepage. Does anyone have any info about finding products like these anywhere in this god forsaken country? Would really appreciate any leads. Thanks!","Tracing coolant leaks can be challenging, but various methods exist for detection. Genuine coolants from Toyota, Honda, and Suzuki create distinct traces resembling colorful rock formations, while Havoline coolant may leave black oil stains that wash away with water. Talcum powder, a cost-effective solution, can help detect oil leaks when applied and inspected under strong light. In the USA, dye kits are available for identifying AC and hydraulic leaks. While visual inspection, experience, and common sense are invaluable, it's essential to remain vigilant, considering that seals may degrade over time, potentially leading to leaks. In the used car business, honesty is paramount; deceptive practices may yield short-term gains but compromise long-term success. Establishing trust by providing accurate car assessments, transparent documentation, and reliable repair estimates can attract potential buyers. Consider leveraging workshops for estimates and fostering credibility through platforms like YouTube, where documenting refurbishment processes can garner interest and build a loyal audience.",,
I am trying to look into buying used cars and selling them after refurbishment and minor works. I want opinion of good forum members about: Is this is a good time to get into this work? I think since the production of new cars is going down there might be more need for used cars. So even if I buy and hold car for some time there might be good return on that. What do you think. I am located near Bhatta Chowk Lahore. Can you recommend any good denter painter who will not charge a lot but get the car ready to the condition that it hides the obvious defects and makes it sale ready. What is the best method to sell the car after getting work done? Do showrooms offer you to park your car there? For example on Defence Main Boulevard and Jail Road? What kind of cut do they take? If I try selling it on my own it will require me to arrange for visits and may have to take it somewhere everyday. Might add up to the total cost I will welcome any other suggestion and advice you may have in this regard. I am a bit free these days and can put time in required to do this. Thanks,Are you willing to lie and deceive interested buyers? If yes then sure this business will be good for you. Otherwise there is absolutely no profit in this business. Used cars in Pakistan hold good value you can’t just buy one and sell it for lacs above buying price after holding it for a few weeks. Buying new cars and selling on markup is a different thing tho,,

Lahore in general is a bit expensive when it comes to labor (of course being a big city and plenty of fish in the pond for denter painters : ) ).. however, i think if you can build trust among market and buyers that this man (you in this case) doesn't lie about the condition of the cars and sells them with complete honesty and guarantee of documentation, i think you can create potential buyers traction over time. Another thing is you can also make a youtube channel and document the whole process, how to hunt and refurbish cars .. it can also gain traction.

"Hello everyone, My tension is increasing day by day with Santro. I have a black Santro 2007. Two days ago I realise the engine oil level decreasing. Further black smoke is present in the exhaust. Long story in short I changed the top sensor ( that connected with the throttle body) the fuel average is now pretty good in the city ( 10/L ) as compare to the previous ( 6/L). But light black smoke is still present and I believe the average should be better after fixing the black smoke problem. One mechanic said to change the map sensor but the engine check was not present then why? The second issue is burning engine oil but no blue smoke is present at all. The mechanic said to change the ring, valve, seals. gas kit that will cost me 20k with labor. Please suggest to me how to fix that problem. I am new to the automotive industry. Evey help will be appreciated.

The car was swapped with a 2JZGTE by the previous owner but I bought the car without any engine under the hood. It was parked in a plot for months and the owner wasn't willing to sell it but after 2 months of procrastination, I finally got my hands on it.

The absence of sunroof drain spouts and potential clogging can result in water ingress, causing various problems like bad smells, carpet damage, and rusting of floors and side panels, with accessing the sunroof drain tube potentially requiring dashboard removal. Ensuring thorough rust removal and applying cavity wax is crucial, especially around the lower pinch weld area, to prevent water intrusion. Consider sourcing replacement tail lamps carefully, as USDM lamps may offer a different aesthetic compared to the original double-glazed ones. Additionally, investing in cavity wax and learning its application, such as a homemade mixture of turpentine or odorless spirits, beeswax or paraffin wax, and oil, could protect against future rust. Accessing trapped cavities for wax application typically involves removing rubber bungs from various parts of the car, while other users may have alternative recipes for cavity wax.",,

Despite, all of these difficulties, the first improvement on my new car was going to improve on that hideous looking outdated navigation system. .  . I have used the infotainment system on the little VW Polo that my wife drives. It does beautiful Android Auto and Apple Car Play, which offer far superior navigation experience in my opinion. So I started looking into the current options. I needed a head unit which would replace the factory stereo, features Android Auto for me and hopefully improve sound stage as well the car interior. So after much deliberations, I settled on a Kenwood Double DIN unit. The Kenwood DDX9017DABS  . The unit itself is a 7 inch touch screen, which does digital radio, simultaneous Bluetooth connectivity with 2 devices, 2 video camera inputs (front and rear), 5 channel gold plated output ports, 2 USB ports (can be used for USB memory sticks, connecting and charging phones), out of box steering wheels connectivity for most of the Japanese + Koreans cars.

Please advice guys.","If you intrested in diy then use this instruction. other wise use this information for cast your project enjoy;) Things You'll Need: Step 1 Sketch your design. Without getting your layout on paper first, your body kit is almost guaranteed to look terrible. This is the place to let your artistic side run wild. Get an idea of what you want by looking at existing body kits, and put your favorite aspects of each one into your design. li value=0"" Step 2 After removing the existing bumpers and trim on your car, cut lengths of high-density foam into the approximate sizes of each part. Using blocks of scrap foam, raise each part until it is resting where it will eventually be located. For the time being, you can secure it in place using some duct tape, if you wish. /li li value=0"" Step 3 Following your drawings precisely, use a heavy marker to draw out the details directly onto the foam. Make note of the depth each indentation or cutout should be carved to. Draw half of each body panel first, then carefully measure and copy each design detail to the opposite side to ensure perfect symmetry. All it takes is one mistake to completely ruin the project, so triple check your measurements before work begins. /li li value=0"" Step 4 Begin carving your design into the foam, being careful not to damage the parts during this process. When you lay the fiberglass on top of the foam, remember that each of the parts will be slightly thicker, so compensate for that during your cutting. Make sure every single cut lines up with the marks you drew in the previous step. If you make a mistake, you don't have to scrap the entire piece, just cut out the ruined section, glue another block of foam in its place, and resume work. /li li value=0"" Step 5 Remove the finished foam pieces, and cover them tightly in aluminum foil to prevent the resin from sticking. You may want to use an adhesive spray to hold the aluminum into place on the foam. Next, spray the outside of the foil with a non-stick cooking spray, which will act as a mold release when you remove the fiberglass. The parts are now fully prepped. /li li value=0"" Step 6 Begin laying your fiberglass. Start off with just one sheet soaked in resin, and lay it across the outside of the mold. Use a roller to push out any air bubbles, and tuck the fiberglass sheet around the edges and contours of your body kit. Allow the single sheet of fiberglass to completely dry, then gently pull it off of the foam mold. Be careful, as the single fiberglass sheet will be very fragile. /li li value=0"" Step 7 Reinforce the inside of the parts using multiple layers of thick fiberglass matting. Smooth out the air bubbles on each layer, and allow adequate dry time before moving on to the next layer of glass. By placing this matting on the inside of the parts, you can add as much thickness as desired without changing the outside shape of the finished product. /li li value=0"" Step 8 Sand the outside of the parts using a rough grit sandpaper, to smooth out any bumpy areas or lumps. A metal file can be used around the openings to ensure clean edges. Use a proper breathing respirator, thick gloves, and long sleeves to protect yourself. Once the finished look is achieved, blast the parts with an air comperassor to remove sanding dust, then wipe the entire surface down to remove the last bits. Now is a great time to do a test fit to make sure the parts line up to your satisfaction. /li li value=0"" Step 9 Cover the entire outside surface with Bondo to create a smooth, finished texture much like a worked piece of auto body sheet metal. Multiple layers may be necessary to thoroughly cover the surface. After letting it cure, sand the Bondo to a flat surface, but don't leave it perfectly smooth. You want to finish with a somewhat rough sandpaper to make sure the paint sticks. Wipe the finished product with isopropyl alcohol to prep it for the next step. /li li value=0"" Step 10 Prime the parts for paint. Any commercial automotive primer in a spray can will work fine. Use long, sweeping motions to cover the entire surface. Start spraying the can before it hits the surface, and do not stop spraying until you have completed the sweep, and have cleared the surface on the other side. This ensures uninterrupted coverage. Two coats of primer is plenty, and it only needs to dry 5 to 10 minutes between coats. Let the final coat cure for a couple of hours before moving on to paint. /li li value=0"" Step 11 Paint your body kit. Use the same, long sweeping motions to completely cover the surface. Use multiple coats of very light paint, as opposed to thicker coats. Same with the primer, let it cure for 5 to 10 minutes between coats, then move on to the next one. It may take 10 or more coats to thoroughly cover the surface. When done, top it off with 2 coats of clear coat to protect the finish. /li li value=0"" Step 12 Mount the body kit to your car. You can use the same mounting system that the original bumpers and trim pieces used, though depending on your car, you may have to craft some custom brackets to do so. Double-check clearances to make sure the panels are tight and everything looks like a good fit. /li",,

Recently got my cng tuned and my plugs may be good for another 1000 kms. Please share the prices when you check them. Thanks Another (and the proper) way to check if a certain plug would suit your car or not is to know the 'engine heat range' of daewoo. i believe plugs have that range (for which they are compatible) mentioned on their box. this way you can even opt for a 2tip/4tip plug provided you know whats the engine heat range of the car that you are installing them in. Try asking that from testdriver/shaan on the daewoo fan club or anyone else that has a manual. You may also visit Mr iqbal at daewoo plus (in g10, behind urdu university), I've heard he worked in daewoo korea, is very knowledgeable and has had this workshop for the last decade.

NITTO ELECTRICIANS Are Just Not Enough For This Job...Ur ECM Is Always On Risk In Their Hands....!! So Be Careful....!! 4.Check For Wheel Bearings And Brake Dics(Front) Drums (Rear) And Replace Them Now...While Opening Hubs..Check For Wheel Bearings Too And If Sounding....Also Replace Wheel Bearings....Put New PADS And If Possible Use Some Bigger Discs Available A/c To Spec Of Car Since You Are Going To Put Heavy And More Fast Thing..So Brakes Must Be Perfect....!! 5.A/c To Engine Weight You Need Heavy Front Shocks Too....Diesel Model Shocks Can Do Job As They Are Heavy Enough For Weighty Engines.....If Bought Any Shock From 2nd Hand Market..Just Don't Put Them As They Came.....Remove Springs And Check Either Shock Is In working Condition ..Not Leaking..Or Weak Enough.....!!

Using Wrong Oils In Gearbox Can Cause Damage To Synchronizers...So Confirm And Use Correct One....!! 9...Swapping Fuel Pump Inside Fuel Tank Needs Opening Of Tank And Soo....Remember To Get A Bowl Type Square Box Built 1st And Place It Inside Fuel Tank 1st And Swap Pump Base In That Bowl....!! If You Don't...You Will Face Fuel Starvation Issue Later....And Always Use Intank Fuel Pump....Don't Go For Inline (External) Fuel Pumps As They Just Are Easy To Install But Quiet dangerous And Risky As They Get leak......So Make Complete Intank Fuel Pump Setup along With Return Line....!! 10...Swapping Bigger Engines 1NZ-FE/4A-5A-7AFE/4EFE Would Need Bigger Diameter Exhaust Pipe Since A/c To Power Need.....Get Atleast (1 3/4"") (45mm) Piping Done From Manifold Till Tail In Order To Make Engine Release Exhaust Easily...!!

Get a flaring tool to make flares on the new pipe and use the original nuts on your pipe bend the pipes as required and before installing them get them hot dipped or galvanized so they dont rust.

I've bought a Diahatsu move. Old owner has installed Amp + Subwoofer. I want to remove that because subwoofer has taken half of boot space. Without that door speakers are giving very flat sound. Old owner said that I can't get good sound with door speakers because doors do no have enough space for big magnets. I'm not sure if thats true. Because nowdays even small bluetooth speakers can generate rich and loud sound. Are there any good speakers for doors that can produce good crisp sound with reasonable bass? P.S. The car has touch panel with equalizer feature.,"In order to get better midbass response, you need to do some sound deadening in your doors. Aftermarket speakers can usually be installed with plastic rings to adjust the mounting depth. Leave the amplifier even if you want to remove the sub. Aftermarket speakers will run better off with an external amplifier than the headunits built in amplifier. If you space for speakers in the the rear doors, install some Aftermarket coaxils there too. Run all four speakers from the amp. Remember, your speakers won't produce the same low end tones that a sub can. However, with some good after market coaxials, an amp and some decent sound deadening, you won't lack a punch",,

If I were you, I would make some very tall stands for the car and unbolt everything from it specially under it, replace all rubber bits and repair metal parts - coat new metal parts like brake lines, fuel lines etc and install back with all clamps in place. It will give you a very good ""base control"" to compare to. If you are going to blindly trust the mechanic/denter/electrician/ustaad - then you are signing up for a bull fighting match. Unless you have infinite pockets of money its best to at least do it 50% DIY - that way you know how to measure what those guys are upto. e.g. simple procedure of packing front wheel bearings becomes a nightmare because ustaad ki grease dibbi is actually chit, ustaad refuses to buy high temp lith complex grease for disc brakes because it costs Rs 1000/kg.

"Hey guys i was considering to dampen my jeep to improve both sound and ride quality. Just wanted to know what options i have available here. Currently i have the desi ""namda"" or wool insulation and im not happy with it at all!! any idea what the cost of products like dynamat is here in the isb/rwp area? and how well will it perform if used to insulate the floor and firewall. Another one i thought of was peel and seel, is that stuff any good or a waste of money?

I'm looking to get the cabin as quiet as possible and areas that will be sealed are; the complete floor area + area behind dashboard, doors, wheel arches, boot space, roof and under the bonnet. oh and let me know if there's any other areas that should be insulated as well.

Thanks in advance Durrani","omarss;4259542: You cheapest solution is that. But considering OP already has namda installed and not happy with that, i would assume he is looking for a higher level of sound insulation. I would say 75% vibration damping and 100% sound insulation using good materials. Lanbo is a good cheap alternative but peel n seal is a different thing altogether. its meant for sealing broken roofs. It may work ok for the floor but not so sure about vertical installations as the black part of the peel n seal is not very heat resistant and would become soft when the temperature rises. Correct me if I am wrong. I havent used peel n seal. Peel and Seal does not become soft under heat and stays attached like a bond, just like Dynamat, STP Sound Deadner, Stinger Roadkill or Damp pro, however yes it has a complete different application however its heavy and used Butyl rubber with adhesive on one end and foil type material on the other end. Its the cheapest solution out there. Jumbolon is a different type and one its application is sound deadening, which can be called, a 'Jugaar'. Recommended dampening is Jumbolon for floor and all other areas, Dynamat equivalent brands which include STP, Roadkill etc for the outer frame of the door. The inner side can be applied with Lambo sheets. Peel and Seal is not available here so won't consider it.",,

So yeah, i think it shoudnt be a problem on doors, fender arches and the floor. about the roof, id say go for lambo or the more expensive stuff. yawar has also explained why P&S does the job so well too. about where to find it. well its cheap and alot of sites have them so id say importing them isnt hard or expensive. there is a 70% on a brand that makes deadening sheets and mats, i saw it somewhere. will check it out post the link here.",,

I keep hearing stuff about advancer, emulator and lambda ? what the hell are these things and why are they important ? And do I need to have all 3 parts in the CNG Kit ? What spark plugs should I use for the best pick on CNG ? Which Oil is the best for the car ? Any specific measurements for RIM/Tires that I should keep in mind ? Because I hate the original wheel caps! Secondly, I had a prosmatec of 2005. When I had CNG Kit installed, power staring got really hard to turn. I'm assuming it must be because of weight of CNG Cylinder ? but that didn't make a lot of sense. Please also advise on how to take care of Reborn after installing CNG Kit ? Thanks","Bro please have mercy on your REBORN..agter having cng for 3 years in my civic 2000 i , selling it infact its removed from the car.54/kg ho ya 5/kg its all drama ur engine is finished and the money u save on every fil ..u actually spend at the workshops..My uncle and we bough civic on same day and year and till now i have my head done one but my uncle car's mileage is 242k and mine is just 180k.... that's the reason i m selling it now plus i have spend much more amount on car repairs and maintenance..never opt for cng..as reborn is car worth driving on petrol..cng is for shitty Suzukis",,

And now with new rates this saving will go above 8500Rs per month. I drive my car for around 1800KM a month. Petrol. 1800 / 12 X 102 = 15300 Cng. 1800 / 20 X 62 = 5580.,,

Thanks","mileage of cng fitted reborn prosmatec in lahore. 60kg cylinder. 100-120km within city and around 120-140km out of city with/without ac. petrol average is 8km/l within city and 12km/l on highways. MANUAL reborns perform better than the above mentioned values. You can get any simple CNG kit in your car. No lambda kit is needed for reborn. Nothing happens to the engine if you dont abuse it. Gear technology is simple and its absolutely fine to run on CNG. BUT, if you want it to be on its toes every time you floor it, then dont go for CNG. You will have to compromise a little on that case. Apart from that, all is well. emulator and advancer increase car's pic and response on CNG. use them. Prices can be checked from KHI market. Landirenzo is the best. Get it from any famous CNG fitter in KHI. Plugs must be used as per civic's manual. Honda also has its own engine oil. You can use that also. Earlier it was the same as Caltex Havoline (Black can) as both were being made by Chevron Limited. Now Honda has given the contract to some other company. I however still use Havoline in 2007 reborn and change every 3000km. CNG installation should not make any difference on power steering. Hope it helps.",,

"Time to Edit This Post Again. A while ago, I'd taken delivery of these two cars, almost side by side. The first was a '67 Impala, which made its way over to the workshop almost straight away for some major refit and refurbishment. A lot of hard work went into this machine; in virtually all areas possible. The body, the interior, engine, suspension, ergonomics, cosmetics. And now, by Allah's grace, it's complete. It boasts a good body, a 350 cubic inch (5700 cc) engine, and a three speed automatic transmission. The vehicle rides on 20 inch wheels clad with 295/40 tyres. My son, Shayaan, was very closely involved with the rebuild of this creature. It was at his insistence that we opted for it to be returned to as close to stock, as was possible. It was at his urging, that we adopted some non-stock touches to embellish and beautify the car, at the same time. Yeh uss ki zidd thi, ke hum iss ko ""Supernatural"" wali Impala banayen. This is very much HIS car. I hope that when he grows up a little more (he's currently just short of 17 years of age, and will not be getting the car until he's 18), he learns to appreciate this machine and all others like it. I sincerely hope he also learns how to have fun with these lightning-strike monsters; but does so responsibly, and sensibly.   The other car, is MY car. This one is a '65 which I bought a while ago. It had been recently rebuilt with a 3000 cc 6 cylinder engine, with a 3 speed automatic transmission, and sported 16 inch rims clad with 195/60 tyres. The car underwent some ""cosmetic surgery"" in the form of a flame-paint job, and also had its interior completely refinished in crimson and black. For the engine, we chucked out the 6 potter and bunged in a 4000 cc 1UZ-FE VVTi, V8, with a 5 speed Tiptronic gearbox. The suspension underwent a complete overhaul, as did the exhaust. The vehicle retains its 'old' rims, but now wears 225/60 tyres. This car is still 'incomplete' in the sense that it's going to get a cosmetic makeover in the near future. Perhaps some much-needed body work, along with some charcoal-coloured matte wrap, and some re-chroming. Maybe some blacked-out wheels. Until then, it continues to breathe fire on the roads, and be an absolute pleasure to drive and own.   Although, hum baap beta aapas mein, apni apni car ki siftein parhtey rehte hain...we're both grateful to Allah Almighty, who's given us the wherewithal and the opportunity to own these great rides!",Saw these Impala's along with Fouad My vote is to rebuild them one by one Fouad if u need any kind of help in procuring parts then do let me know,,

"Although i need to learn a lot about project management and time management but still this will be my next project car Inshallah immediately after liteace comes to and end is sent to Faisalabad. This is my Taya's 74 corolla. He bought it himself and drove it as a daily runner. Sadly he died in 1976 at the age of 43. My father kept quiet about custody of the car so far waiting for the things to get favourable. now we can get it as per free will of the curent users in the family. This project again will be a very touching and full of affiliations, especially for my father. I was born in 1976 and i can only feel what he has for this car. I will be putting in my heart and soul into it and need the usual support from the fellow pakwheelers.     we also have service booklet of the same car with my Taya's name on it.

So the stock head-unit that Toyota provided in these cars wasn't at any level even near what a true audiohead would want in their car. The audio quality was FAIR at best and considering these are locally produced, that's pretty obvious The AVH-2550NEX is a great headunit featuring a 6.8"" display, Amazon Alexa, Apple Carplay, Android Auto, SirusXM, Weblink, Spotify, Pandora, Dual camera inputs, selectable guidelines etc. More importantly, it features a 13 band EQ, built in DSP with auto/manual TA, HPF/BP/LPF Crossover Network, Full active Network mode, 24 Bit DA Converter and Auto EQ. All of this comes at a reasonable $550-$600 price tag depending on where you source the headunit from but it's a worthwhile investment if you are not a fan of those larger panels and want to maintain the OE look of the dash.",,

First up is the Roof. The reason I decided on using the sound deadening sheets on the roof (~60-70% application area) was because its hella annoying to hear the rain slapping against the metal sheet above your head while youre listening to music. I had to experience this with my 2019 PKDM Alto ( Was worse than this ) and the deadening sheets made a hell of a difference completely eliminating the sounds of rain against the roof. You will instantly realize its the rain hitting the windscrean now that will bother you but hay, that still isnt as bad as the roof We can then move onto the Doors, the rear parcel shelf area and the Rear wheel arches Finally, we move to the smaller regions, the A,B,C Pillars Despite the fact that these are all strong points when it comes to metal sturdiness (due to the welding points and double metal sheets at the corners), I wanted to cover these up for my peace of mind",,

First up, a look at the 2 different type of CCF Sheets being used in the build. Let's start with the door cards. Pictures show the driver and right rear passenger door panels. The process repeats for the other two doors. Each was cleaned with a solution of Isopropanol and wiped dry. The different sections of these door cards are held with small metal screws. Since these are screwed into plastic, these tend to loosen with time. I simply grabbed some red thread locker, put a small dab and retightened all of them Once the screws were tightened on all 4 door cards, I applied the same sound deadening material on them. Just like in the case of metal, these help the plastics from flexing by adding weight to the panel itself Next we can move onto the CCF application. Each Sheet is 100x50x2.5 cm in total.",,

Sometimes you will get to know any demage or new dent or any thing happen to your car which you are not aware of. Service station guys dont care about cloth using on the car and leave with beautiful swril marks on your car. Get any pressure washer with less power. To my understanding cleaning car with high pressure is not suitable. If you have good pressure in tap, you can simply get a good garden hose gun and it will done your work perfectly. Using water less spray washer or quick detailers are just fancy things and spending extra money to my point of view. Avoid dry dusting your car. Micro fibre clothes are useful. For interior cleaning you can get any wet n dry vaccum cleaner. It will do your house work as well. Using blower to clean interior is not really useful to my view because it blows dust to others area of the car. Vaccum cleaner is better than blower. Btw, after long time once i washed car with regular hose pipe and found it way better than these pressure washers. Idk why. Washing car from bneath is important also. And lubricant car suspension is also important. Dont wash engine bay ever. Get a simple spray bottle and clean with it.

"Assalamualaikum. I restored a Honda Accord 1985 - 1600CC car back in January 2022. It cost me almost 100k-120k to bring it back to its current condition from being completely non-functional. However, as a student, I couldn't afford to invest another 100k for further repairs such as mechanical issues. As a result, the car has been idle for almost 1.5 years. As someone who is passionate about cars, it breaks my heart to see my favorite car, my project car, in such a condition. I feel even worse because I have an emotional attachment to this car. I need some help and suggestions to revive this beauty and get it back on the road. Those who own or appreciate this particular model will understand its value and how comfortable the ride is. Thank you in advance for any suggestions and help regarding parts and repairs. Please share this post so that it reaches Mr. Suneel Munj, as I really don't want to sell this car. I love her and I want to restore her so that I can use her as my daily driver again.",Where is the picture? How can we find out what work has been done?,,

"Hello everyone, As the title suggests, I will start with the details. Like any other car enthusiast, it has always been my dream to restore an eg8 that closely resembles a Ferio. I purchased this 1994 Civic back in 2012 with the intention of restoring it, and I have owned this car for over a year now. The car has been good to me, with no engine problems or starting issues. The car runs perfectly fine, as the previous owner had replaced the engine with a D15B 3-stage VTEC. It also has 17-inch rims and a modified body kit. The car was in excellent condition both inside and out, with no major accidents involved. -  - Initial plans: I wanted to remove the body kit, strip the car down to bare metal to get rid of any rust, and then work on the body by redefining the lines and ensuring high-quality paintwork. I also planned to remove the carpet to check for any rust and found that the floor was in good condition. The tires needed to be replaced. -  - Shopping list:  - 1. Front/back bumpers (Taiwan) - 2.

"Dear All. I am purchasing KIA Picanto A/T in Mercury Blue color. Minor scratches are more visible in dark color vehicles so i am a bit worried about it. After my research i have identified two possible solutions, Paint Protection Film (PPF) or Ceramic Coating. Which one is better?","When considering paint protection options like Paint Protection Film (PPF) versus Ceramic Coating, it's important to understand their differences. PPF provides a durable shield against dings, scratches, and stone chips, making it ideal for protecting your car's paint. On the other hand, Ceramic Coating offers a slick, hydrophobic finish that enhances shine but may not offer the same level of protection against physical damage. Some view Ceramic Coating as akin to a lacquer coat, albeit less durable, lasting only a year or two if properly maintained. PPF, being a thermoplastic urethane film, offers more permanent protection against abrasions and minor damage. However, if PPF is damaged in a specific area, the entire panel may need replacement. Ultimately, the choice between PPF and Ceramic Coating depends on your priorities and budget, with PPF being a more robust but expensive option compared to Ceramic Coating, which requires multiple layers for effective protection.",,

My question is how to wash the exhaust pipe? Is it safe to put a water pipe in the exhaust and clean it with water?

"Car starts during daytime when temperature is around 21 22C but doesn't start and gives a weak self sound like when the battery is dead, during the night and early morning when it's super cold outside, is it time to replace the battery? This situation is after 12 13 days parked car","If your car battery is draining over a week or so, despite being only a year old, it's essential to diagnose the issue. Start by checking the battery cells and ensuring they are functioning correctly. Lubricating the terminals with grease or petroleum jelly can prevent powder deposits. Next, examine the starter, alternator, and battery using a voltmeter. A healthy battery should read around 12.6 volts or higher. If it reads significantly lower, there may be a discharge issue or a failing battery. In the case of a Baleno 2005 experiencing cold start issues only after the car has been sitting for a week or more, despite having a working alternator and starter, consider other factors such as additional electrical components like amplifiers or potential parasitic drains.",,
"Hi, I have nissan march 1997. Few weeks back, I changed its radiator and ac condenser due to leakage. It was in winters. Now, in summers, its ac does not work very well. The guy from shershah gave me the radiator and condenser of 1000c imported wagon r for fitting. Its condenser size is half of what nissan's used to be. So, will changing the condenser to a bigger or original size fix the cooling problem in summers? Thanks","Go find the original parts and install them, the condenser and evaporator are a matched set, in your case you have very little liquid volume compared to vapour volume. Nothing else will help, and also find a good ac tech fhat owns a real vacuum pump and scales. Dont let them guess the charge or try to adjust the charge just by looking at pressure",,

If you change condenser to multiflow type then make sure its about the same size as the old one and it has manifold tanks too. This will keep the system balanced. Also make sure the AC mechanic knows how to install a T shape expansion valve correctly and also how to insulate it correctly. The performance of it is highly dependant on its installation - the sensing bulb has a certain orientation/clocking of it relative to the suction line to sense the correct temperature of the discharging refrigerant from the evaporator. Placing it too low or too high is bad.,,
"Hi, I have nissan march 1997. Few weeks back, I changed its radiator and ac condenser due to leakage. It was in winters. Now, in summers, its ac does not work very well. The guy from shershah gave me the radiator and condenser of 1000c imported wagon r for fitting. Its condenser size is half of what nissan's used to be. So, will changing the condenser to a bigger or original size fix the cooling problem in summers? Thanks","I think this task is beyond your scope. Study it a bit then make your decision on how to make it work or get it worked on (meaning be informed so you can measure the workmanship being recieved) The expansion valve is T shaped in your car rather than the H shaped one used on modern corollas. Installing the H shape requires no skill, T shape requires brains and skill, make sure mechanic understands such. Forgetting to insulate the T shaped valve will result in bad working, same with installing its sensing bulb wrong.",,

"I simply dont understand that how can someone just out of his behind determine that the diesel engine is dead because of back blow... Did they check compression? (They wont even have a diesel tester) Was a proper vent check done? Maybe its restricted Did they check the valve clearances? Can cause noisy intake and blow like crazy (cylinders not filling with full air and hence no compression load on the rings) Did they actually check the timing..(forces the rings to expand on the power stroke sealing it at TDC) Diesel engines will last for at least 400,000 kms easily without breaking a sweat.. I simply cant fathom the fact - even dealerships in Pakistan lack the diesel compression tester - and just rely on the musings of an old **** of a diesel mechanic that the engine is dead.. And customers fall for it. - I wouldve made them sweat for their money before they hand me some crap like that","When inspecting for back blow in a diesel engine, particularly when hot and at normal idle speed, a method involves opening the oil cap and using a piece of paper above the filler opening. The paper should flutter or be pushed up slightly, indicating proper sealing. Revving the engine should cause the paper to go dead or be sucked in, signifying potential issues like blowby. Checking for compression, timing, and valve clearances is essential. If air is observed being pushed out of the intake manifold, further examination of the timing belt, valve clearances, and injection pump pressure is warranted. Deviations in nozzle breaking pressure can affect engine performance, leading to symptoms like black or white smoke. For a Toyota 2C engine, the nozzle breaking pressure should be within specified ranges, and internal pump pressure at idle speed should be checked. Diesel Power Systems on Sh Faisal in Karachi is recommended for diesel pump services, although finding a shop knowledgeable about pump advance and internal pressure is crucial. Be cautious of the pump cold start device, which can impact timing when stuck or malfunctioning.",,

The system can: Show the location of your vehicle on PC / Mobile Send mileage / maintenance notifications over mobile and through email Send over speeding notification over mobile and through email Send notifications over mobile and through email if the vehicle goes out of a predefined area The approximate cost for installation would be around Rs. 10,000-15,000 with a monthly service charges of approximately Rs. 1500-3000 depending on the services activated. I am planning to move back to Pakistan this December I have already tested a prototype in Pakistan and now I am really looking forward to set up this system. But now I need feeback from the market which is you guys :).

Average cost of the device would not cost more than Rs 15000 as I have imported two average trackers in past from china for Rs 7000 each including shipment charges and Rs 13000 a good quality tracker. Be very clear, you don’t need to bring third party companies in between in order to watch your vehicle. GPS signals is free for entire world so no monthly cost is involved. Only cost involved is the charges which cell phone companies charges from you once you send an SMS to a friend. Because commands are sent through SMS and car replies through SMS. Once I top up 100 Rs balance in my cars device then it lasts for more then 4 months. Trackers are only toys as companies which sells tracker for USD 100 also sells jammers for USD 20.

The measures to take are ensure the high pressure switch is actually functioning and be positively sure that your expansion valve is in perfect working order, The newer corollas require removal of the entire dashboard to service the A/C (the TXV valves installed by Indus motors are not good) - most shops would not take such a job as it takes one whole day to service and put back. a malfucntioning H block TXV will block gas flow and literally blow apart the compressor if the high pressure cut off switch is not working - (most A/C shops in Pakistan cut that first - because the snooty and snobby car owners want their 2D A/C to perform like a VW Phaeton A/C regardless of temperature) Secondly when the A/C shops discharge the gas - oil is lost too, and they do not put in the required and recommended oil for 134 as it is very very expensive, Rs 12,000 for a 4 litre bottle. Ive seen some shops put in ester oil (of R12) in R134 units. I wanted to cry/laugh at the same time. A collection of the above causes failures left and right. Ever wonder why people in other countries are not changing A/C compressors every year. I used to own a 1997 Camry 3.0 here in the US - I recently sold it with 200,000 miles (320,000 kms) it was using the original 10 cylinder denso compressor that the toyota factory put in (same corolla compressor). I did however have service records that the TXV and drier were replaced in 2005. Measure for yourself now.",,

"HI Guys, I am starting this thread to specifically focus on the types of protections available for the body paint. Main points to consider would be : 1 - Protection against minor scratches and stone chips 2 - body colour preservation 3 - Hydrophobic qualities 4 - level of gloss Pros please comment on this !","To protect your car's paint from potential damage in hot weather, it's essential to follow some maintenance tips. Firstly, regular washing with a mild car shampoo using soft tools like a sponge or microfiber cloth helps remove dust and pollutants without scratching the paint. Applying a protective wax or sealant provides an extra layer of defense against UV rays and heat, extending the paint's lifespan. Parking in shaded areas and using a breathable car cover further minimizes exposure to direct sunlight, preventing paint fading or cracking. Avoiding abrasive materials during cleaning and maintaining regular waxing and polishing routines also contribute to preserving the paint's appearance. While these measures can help, it's important to note that they may not entirely prevent issues like Florida paint cancer or swirl marks caused by improper washing techniques. Additionally, understanding different paint protection products like wax, sealants, ceramic coatings, paint protection film (PPF), and vinyl wrap can guide you in choosing the right option based on your car's needs and budget. Sealants, for instance, are suitable for daily-driven cars, offering good durability without the expense of ceramic coatings, while products like Menzerna Power Lock and Sonax PNS are recommended for their proven effectiveness. Ultimately, maintaining your car's paint not only enhances its appearance but also preserves its resale value over time.",,
"Hi every body, i want knowledge regarding pros and cons of automatic and manual gear shifting system plz give your opinion thanx","Opting for a manual transmission is preferred due to its easy maintenance and cost-effectiveness, especially considering the affordability of replacing a worn clutch plate compared to the expensive automatic gearbox kit. While newer car models may offer improved technology, manual control is valued, particularly in situations like getting stuck in mud, where gear shifting aids in control. Personal experience, such as handling a Corolla with brake failure by shifting gears, reinforces the reliability of manual transmission, especially in remote areas with limited access to workshops and mechanics. Additionally, anecdotes like a lancer's automatic gear failure within six months of use in a village context underscore concerns about automatic transmission durability. However, opinions may vary, with some viewing automatic cars as a luxury, appreciating models like the 2002 Oriel PT. Nonetheless, considerations of fuel efficiency, maintenance costs, and performance characteristics between automatic and manual transmissions highlight the multifaceted nature of the debate. For instance, automatic transmissions tend to be thirstier on fuel, require costly servicing, and may deteriorate if maintenance is overlooked, with fewer pre-owned autos observed to be in good condition. Technical differences, such as torque converter operation relying on oil pressure and its implications for power transmission and towing capacity, further delineate the differences between automatic and manual transmissions. Finally, in instances of car battery failure, manual transmission cars may be push-started, while automatics necessitate alternative solutions like jump-starting or seeking assistance from another vehicle.",,
I have bought a 82 corolla with 2c engine pre installed car is working fine but there is an oil leak from the back where engine connects with transmission i got it checked from a local mechanic he told me that was main seal leak and with cost minimum 7k labour as whole transmission will be removed . So my concerns is what is that seal actually called and can i get it replaced cheaper in lahore and please recommend any diesel mechanic for normal tune up/check up as this is my first car as a student I don’t have that much budget car itself was low on oil so i filled it right now till i can get it replaced by a professional,"You can visit @syncview, call before visit, He will also deal with the fan and t-stat",,
"From past year the Ac hasn't been performing well when the car is stopped. Took it to a local workshop the guy said gas is less than half and that I should just top up. Came home and researched online, seems like a lot of people are getting their AC serviced but not sure what exactly is involved in that procedure? Do they take off entire dashboard and remove evaporator coil to clean it? Is it necessary if our car has cabin filter that was cleaned/replaced regularly? Saw videos online of people cleaning evaporator without taking it off and just using spray foams. Is there someone in Lahore that does that?

Scratches that do no go deeper than the clear coat are easily removed and if done properly will not be visible standing a few feet from the car.

Clean the pipes coming from tank to carbo. Clean / service the carborator. Change the fuel pump. change the fuel filter. After taking all above measures my problem is still there and I'm really disheart now. Could you guys help me to solve this myth. What should I do now...

Basic problem was car felt heavy to drive in night with lights on. Thought to have alternator tested. Recently placed new belt and appropriate tension was given. Car is Cold so is alternator No Load Condition:  @ idle Battery Voltage = 14.2 V @2k RPM Battery Voltage = 14.2 v On- Load: Head- Lights, Low and High Beam  @ idle Battery Voltage = 13.7 V @2k RPM Battery Voltage = 13.7 v With AC along with blower motor  @ idle Battery Voltage = 13.4 V @2k RPM Battery Voltage = 13.4 v Car and Alternator are hot   No Load Condition:  @ idle Battery Voltage = 13.7 V @2k RPM Battery Voltage = 13.9 v On- Load: Head- Lights, Low and High Beam  @ idle Battery Voltage = 13.4 V @2k RPM Battery Voltage = 13.5 v With AC along with blower motor  @ idle Battery Voltage = 12.9 V @2k RPM Battery Voltage = 13.4 v From tests above i think alternator 's voltage regulator is weak i guess as it gets too hot under load. You cant touch it. As compared to power pump that is on same bracket so if it was engine transferring heat it should be almost same.

My brake shoes are good but the pedal goes way down. So I am thinking of changing the brake oil for the first time. How much will it cost. labour plus oil? Where to get it done? Someone who will bleed the air out properly too.,"All cars require brake fluid changes annually to prevent internal rusting of brake systems caused by moisture absorption. It's essential to consult the owner's manual for specific maintenance guidelines. For instance, Toyota Xli typically requires brake fluid changes every 40,000 kilometers, along with transmission and power steering oil replacements at the same interval. The user manual outlines detailed periodic maintenance schedules, including conditions for changing gear oil, which can be obtained from a 3S dealer. When planning brake fluid changes, consider sourcing genuine fluid from trusted dealerships to ensure authenticity. Service charges for brake fluid changes vary, with some dealerships offering comprehensive brake services at competitive rates. Prioritizing preventive maintenance, including brake service and suspension checks, can significantly enhance vehicle safety and prevent accidents, as experienced firsthand by a grateful driver who avoided two potential collisions thanks to recent maintenance work.",,

"Assalamualaikum. I have a Toyota Corolla AE100 - 5a-fe Engine SE LIMITED JDM Year 94 which has an engine vibration issue. Both my mechanic and friend have informed me that the vibration is due to weak engine foundations. Therefore, I am planning to replace the old foundations with new ones.  -  - 1.

Are the foundations available in the Plaza Market in Karachi better than the ones in Sharjah, UAE? Or should I buy them from Karachi instead? -  - 3. I only need a set of 4 mounts from Sharjah, UAE. Would it be better to change all 4 foundations for improved performance, or should I only change the one that is causing the issue? The rubber on both the front and rear foundations is quite soft, and there are 1 or 2 minor cracks. I haven't checked the gearbox and driving seat foundations yet. -  - One more thing, this car was imported from Japan in 2006 and has been with me since then. A few years ago, my brother had replaced the mount for the driving seat with a used one. As of now, the car has covered a total of 87,000 km since 2006, with 72,000 km already driven in Japan. So, it has covered a total of 159,000 km. Thank you.","For your Toyota Corolla AE100 with a 5A-FE engine experiencing vibration issues, it's recommended to choose genuine Japanese foundations, ensuring they are new stock for freshness. Purchasing locally in Karachi, possibly from a Toyota showroom, could be a reliable and cost-effective option. Considering the soft rubber and minor cracks in both front and rear foundations, it's advisable to replace all 4 foundations to enhance performance and address potential issues comprehensively.",,

I am using Zic A+ for engine oil. Regards,","GoodMan7;4066878: Brother, local companies' ATF (Automatic Transmission Fluid) aren't good. Honestly, they must be chosen wisely; otherwise, they can harm the entire gear system like slow poison. I highly recommend using TOYOTA CVT FLUID TC, 4L Category: Transmission Fluid. Product Name: TOYOTA CVT FLUID TC Part No: 08886-02105 Type: Fully Synthetic Manufacturer: Exxon Mobil Japan Volume: 4L This is the best and purest synthetic gear oil for CVT engines. I'm sure that if you use it in your car, your car will feel as good as honey. You can find more information about this oil at https://www.pakwheels.com/forums/d-i-y-projects/168298-transmission-oil-change-toyota-vitz-belta-passo-toyota-k410-transmission I used T-IV (ATF) from Toyota, and it is really low-quality oil. Never use ATF from a local company if you want to keep your car happy. By the way, ZIC A+ is good engine oil. Have you tried ZIC OW? For your reference, it's even better than ZIC A+. Cheers and love. Bro, the Suzuki Alto 660 does not have a CVT transmission, so never use CVT oil, just use any ATF. Sent from my A900 using PW Forums mobile app",,

I am using Zic A+ for engine oil. Regards,","Atif_Khan;4067092: Thanks Goodman for the reply.. You are right about the quality of usual available ATF oils but dont you think that Toyota CVT will be too much good for 660 cc car with small transmission system. For Engine, now I am using Havoline due to 2 number Zic in the market. I have used Zic 0W for my City and it works nice with big engines. Brother, As we all generally know that main function of the engine or gear oil is to keep the smooth flow of internal moving parts and reducing their internal friction as minimum as possible. Using low grade ATF or any other cheap oil may harm internal parts (like slow poison). But using Good Grade CVT Oil will make your engine more than Happy. Every day your car itself will open the door for you to sit & enjoy the good drive. lol.... For ZIC, you are very right brother. There are so many fake oils in market now since last two years especially because of increasing deamnds. But luckily still we can trust XQ & OW but have to be purchase from genuine distributor. Zic's other oils, especially ZIC A+, A & Hi-Flow, ...... oh gosh, its hard to trust their quality. ZIC XQ & OW are good for new engines, either these are small cars or big. Similarly more than 70% people in market selling fake Havoline (deeping down their own graves), but the point is that who knows this fact or even who bother to know this naked truth !!!

"I just got some side screen shades for my Civic, and some dude told me that they are illegal. Isb police love to get ppl on anything. Any ideas?","While there may be rumors suggesting that cars registered under women's names are allowed to use side shades, it's uncertain whether this is true. Additionally, obtaining permission from the Commissioner might grant permission, particularly for individuals with genuine skin conditions preventing sun exposure. While side shades may not be explicitly illegal, they pose hazards and require careful driving. In other countries like UAE and China, black tint is allowed, but such leniency is not observed due to law and order concerns in Pakistan. Islamabad police faced a setback when a driver contested a challan for using a mobile phone while driving, with the court ruling that no law prohibits such behavior. Similarly, whether screen shades are illegal under Islamabad's Motor Vehicle law should be verified, and contesting a ticket in court may be necessary. Despite being technically illegal, many drivers use tinted windows without police intervention, although fines ranging from 400 to 700 Rupees may be imposed if caught.",,

Despite various attempts, including throttle body cleaning, air filter changes, and plug replacements, the problem persists, with fluctuating RPMs and stalling. Given the complexity of EFI systems and the potential impact of the engine swap, it's recommended to conduct a comprehensive diagnostic scan by a professional auto-electrician to identify any stored error codes in the Engine Control Unit (ECU). Additionally, ensure proper connections of the Circuit Opening Relay (COR) and main relay, as these play a crucial role in the EFI system. Checking for vacuum leaks, inspecting the throttle position sensor (TPS) calibration, and consulting with an EFI specialist may offer further insights into resolving the issue effectively.",,

While adding a turbo can potentially yield a significant torque boost in diesel engines, there are factors to consider. The CT12, with a larger turbine, might be suitable, but running too much boost can risk damaging non-turbo pistons. It's crucial to ensure the engine has turbo pistons, as they have additional oil cooling features. Carefully monitor boost levels to prevent engine stress. Additionally, for noticeable horsepower gains, other modifications like optimizing fuel injection, enhancing air intake, and improving exhaust flow can be explored. Consulting with experienced turbocharging specialists is advisable to avoid potential engine damage.",,

However the exchange is possible.","Instead of opting for costly repairs on a 2 million asset, it might be better to consider selling and booking a new one, although the timing for selling could have been better. Regarding replacing the manual knob type AC unit in an Altis Grande with an auto/electric one, the whole unit needs to be replaced, involving significant cost, unless one opts for a cheaper option from the scrapyard. However, some believe it's not worth the investment, as the single-zone climate control in the Grande may not offer significant advantages, with features like adjusting fan speed to match interior and exterior temperatures, but lacking advanced functionalities like true dual-zone control or additional features such as a charcoal filter or variable AC compressor. While the auto system may trip the compressor when the desired temperature is reached, it also adjusts air blend to maintain the set temperature, potentially reducing how often it needs to restart.",,

"Hello guys, as you might have guessed from my old signature I'm all against HID kits and all that.Whenever I see a thread with ""HID"" in the title,I immediately jump to it to share my views.Most people have some wrong ideas about HID and projector lights.I am going to copy and paste some of the information I shared in the old forums but did not get noticed. Here we go:  Common misconception:  ""projectors are useless without hid , with normal bulbs u will face many problems in vision""  Actuality:  That is far from true, projectors have far better output even with halogen bulbs, take the camry for example it comes with halogen projectors and light output is WAY better compared to a reflector housing. Projectors come in two different types. 1.Halogen 2. HID .... Now aftermarket projectors that are sold ... 99.9% of them are Halogen projectors ... but as everyone does not know this , they put HID's in the Halogen Projectors and the output is ridiculous to say the least.The reason is because the focal point of the halogen bulb is different from the HID bulb. Misconception:  ""Why Install Projectors in The First Place??.. Why Not Only Install HID's In Stock HeadLamps??.. They Give More Light Than Projectors.."" Actuality:  That is also false, HID in reflector housings gives the worst output.The glare you get is blinding to say the least.Most of the folks put HID in halogen projectors and then complain that the output is worse. Here is the output of light in descending order: HID Projector>Halogen Projector>Reflector Housing. Now let me show you comparison pictures of outputs in different applications. Real HID Projector Output: No light above the cutoff line  Another image of a real HID projector( This is a RHD projector, hence the higher side is on the left)  Halogen Projector(with halogen bulb) Output:No light above the cutoff line   Halogen Projector(with HID bulb) Output ... This is a common mistake Notice the Light has dispersed. Light has escaped above the cutoff line.Oncoming traffic gets a little glare in their eyes.  HID in reflector Housing: By far the worst output .Has the worst output. The is no evidence of a cutoff line.That's why the oncoming traffic gets glare in their eyes.   More Pointers:  1. If your car came with Halogens from the factory, Halogens will give you the best visibility(in your stock headlight) no matter what anyone says.  2.The purpose of the high beam is to put light in the distance.When your high beam reflector is not meant for an HID then how in the world is the HID going to be effective. Also HID's take time to come up to full intensity(usually 5-15 seconds) and that defeats the purpose of a high beam.   3.Light output(measured in lumens) is inversely proportional to the color temperature(measured in kelvins or K) so the most light you would get will be out of 4300K(Same color temperature as daylight). Beyond 6000K its just plain useless.  One thing to note the reason that the ""Blue"" HID lights seem to be brighter is because of the simple reason that the human eye is very sensitive to blue light which is the very reason it dazzles our eyes and gives the illusion that it is brighter which in fact is totally false. After-market Projectors All of the projectors headlamps available at car accessory shops are Halogen, most of the people do not know this, and when they buy them and put an HID Kit in the projectors, they start complaining of the lack of visibility.  A simple way of identifying a halogen projector is that it simple uses any of the halogen bulb types for example like H11,H3 etc.  Real HID Projectors use HID bulbs like D2S,D1S etc.   Cars with HID reflector housings(from the factory): Now before you go all flaming on me that there are some cars out their like the 2nd Gen Toyota Prius,9th Gen Toyota Corolla(in some markets),8th Gen Civic Mugen RR etc that have HID's from the factory even though they have a reflector housing; Let me explain that as well The cars above all have one thing in common, their reflector housings were designed from the ground up to be used with an HID bulb.These reflectors are diamond cut for more precise cutoff to reduce most of the glare and use a bulb known as D2R (R for Reflector).Half the bulb glass is covered with paint to reduce the the glare even further.  Now you all be the judge.I have made the mistake of putting HID's in reflector housings but after doing extensive research I have come to the conclusion that HID should only be used in HID Projectors Only.     That is all I can churn out of my useless brain at the moment. Feel free to ask questions, I will be more than happy to answer them.","i've tried explaining this to so many people but they still fit HID's to their cars without doing theor research. also i find it hilarious when peole fit HIDs to their high beams not realizing that these lights hate thermal change and is a huge reason for them failing.

Using the above mention information i know that a Hid projector with a HID can give the desired amount of perfection but how much will it cost ? Not less then $300 and can range till $500. so what can a guy do if he is a budget buyer ? well what i did was buy a HId and shove it in the high beam and when you get tired throw it out and put the halogen back. All i have experienced this and i must say if you have the money to put on it then you can only achieve the results other wise just put an hid satisfy your self for a couple of months and every thing will be fine. second option is that put some good quality halogens they will cost you almost Rs5000 to your door step if you import(i dont think you will find them in the local market.),,

"Hello friends, My lancer 2006 has jerk and missing problem. I have searched on this forum but havenot found the solution. The car is perfect and is never driven on CNG. Engine is perfect with no oil loss. The only problem is the jerks and missing. Sometimes the car is perfectly fine and sometimes it jerks with missing. Missing here refers to very low acceleration, dragging and a feel of power coming and going. The missing issue is not related to fuel pump. I have changed iacv but still the problem is there. As the car jerks engine check light comes on and goes away after 4 5 seconds. So i think it is related to a sensor. I have changed iacv now maf and tps sensor are left. I hope there are no more sensors :). Can any brother help me in finding the issue with his experience?",get it scanned. why wasting money by changing sensors. get t scanned and identify the fault with the code.,,

"Dear All, I was by the River and had to shift to H4 and forgot to turn back and ended up doing 250km with H4 still active. Everything was fine on motorway but when I got back to the city car was acting weird on turns and then I started smelling tyres burning and then I noticed H4 was active. Today I didn't feel the same smoothness anymore so I just wanted to ask what had happened and how it can be fixed I am sure there must be someone else who made the same mistake.

"It has happened to me and now another friend car. My Honda CRZ(k24 swapped) neededa clutch change and the workshop did the job but when they put back the speed snesor ( CSS, Countershaft speed sensor, its in front of transmission and comes with 8th gen onwards Honda, Honda city 2011 onward and 9th gen civic etc etc.) So long story short when the car was put in gear, the snesor touched the gear teaath and ecu got fried and because Hondata Flashpro was locked to it, and no scanner can connect to this ecu, that also got wasted. So i began searching for the solution but online there was no such info of what size washer to put between sensor and transmission. I even looked at Honda manual diagrams and they even dont put any washer there. So after a lot of triala nd testing i have found the solution once and for all. Its so delicate balance between too far or too near. IF even half a millimeter far the speedo and VTEC wont work. HAlf a mm close and you risk fry ecu or sensor. Honda Speed Sensor Washer Mystery Solved. and today morning just recieved a call from friend that They could not start the car aftter chaging the clutch, i immediately guessed what happened and i was right. So if you have a manual Honda with a CSS sensor, which needs a clutch work than buy these cheap wahsers i mentioned in video. that are 10 washers in just RS 450 and can save a lot of money. i wasted 2 lakhs plus. So dont suffer like i did.   https://www.daraz.pk/products/original-jdm-bolts-l-key-styling-universal-bolt-10pis-pakit-i171018394-s1341336922.html4?","When dealing with sensor-related issues, it's crucial to ensure proper handling and maintenance practices. Mechanics should exercise care when removing sensors to prevent misplacement of spacer washers, which are essential for maintaining correct air gaps and sensor functionality. Different manufacturers employ varying sensor configurations, with Honda utilizing a 5V VCC rail for sensor sourcing and feedback. However, mishaps such as wire shorts can disrupt this system, highlighting the need for careful handling. Reinstalling sensors with their original spacers intact is standard practice, as seen in transmissions like Nissan/Jatco CVTs, which require specific shims for maintaining proper air gaps. It's advisable to engage qualified mechanics equipped with modern tools to avoid such issues. Additionally, when dealing with international shipments and customs clearance, proper documentation is essential to verify the origin and status of items, particularly for goods not manufactured in Pakistan. Collaborating with reputable freight companies knowledgeable about the required documentation processes is crucial for smooth transactions and compliance with copyright and import regulations. Industrial equipment control modules often undergo similar shipping procedures for refurbishment, underscoring the importance of engaging experienced freight services for handling such transactions.",,
